I you know you don't have to sign up if you don't want to but you know I'm kind of here to like fix things for you and just make sure everything goes no real smoothly with the different issues that you've been having and just kind of oh you know kind of manage things and just take care of stuff so you know it's again if you want the service you can have it but it's kind of up to you but I am here if you want me to be and you know I'll couldn't kind of teach you about things you might not know about or tell you some things about your house and you know just Marlys make sure everything goes okay so you know you think that might be something you'd be interested in wanting to be a part of because I'd you know really like to help you,0
because it seems like I you know you've expressed some health issues lately and I know you've had a lot of problems with your weight so that's certainly something we can talk about and I know a lot about you know weight loss and have helped a lot of people with you know managing their weight and figuring out what they need to do so you know what are your main problems about your weight I mean why is it a problem for you,0
so why do you eat too much I mean how is that a problem,0
so you like it you just like eating food so you just kind of eat more than you know you should be eating,0
yeah yeah,0
you could tell me about it I mean about what you should be eating for yeah meat size and like you know baseball size for fruit so it's not that you don't know about it you you you do know about poor lighting control,0
so if you know how much you should be eating and then how is it a means you know how much you should be eating then how do you stop,0
well that's great I could do about this yeah because you know there's there's just so many different things when it comes to like weight loss you know and really being able to have some self-control I mean that's a really really important factor this is really being able to have some self-control and you know I found a lot of people just really need to increase their fruits and their vegetables and just not eat any processed foods and you know not eat any anything that might be kind of junk but then you know not not cheat either I mean you want to be able let yourself have some ice cream or some things that you might really like from time to time because you know you don't want to completely not let yourself have good stuff either so,0
oh I see well you know obviously you want to make sure you're not eating you know junk food all day long but on the other hand you want to make sure that you give yourself some opportunities to have that bite of brownie or cake or you know I for myself personally I really love like lemon meringue pie so I always have to you know save that little piece for myself in the fridge to make sure I have my little bite of lemon meringue pie and then I can feel good about you know where I where I was eating good the rest of the day then I could still have my lemon meringue pie so something like that might kind of work better you know for you to really take a look at your portion sizes and then you know making sure you get out there and exercising me if you're not exercising that's certainly not going to help you with being able to get off the weight either so that's that's critical how are you doing on weight loss as far as exercising,0
oh so see that's really key right that's a really key portion to it so it sounds like when we talk next time if you kind of kind of give me an idea maybe keep a journal for a week and tell me what you've been eating and we can really look at you know what good things that I can tell you what things you shouldn't be eating out of that plan and then I really think it'd be important if you just start maybe even just start walking three times a week if you could just start that really slowly and then you Muenster now we can kind of see if that's helped some and we can talk about the items you've had on your journal and we can go from there and all kind of direct you from there what you shouldn't be eating how does that sound,0
sure whatever whatever is comfortable for you so you know start out small so that you can feel really good about having some success and doing some exercise so you know if you feel tired at ten fifteen minutes really just kind of paste it along for yourself and feel what's right so that you can feel like you're getting out there and getting moving because it's all about taking a small step and you know at least getting active,0
and then I think the flute journal would be really important because then we'll really have a better idea what you what you truly are eating and how many calories and then we can go from there and deciding you know how many calories you really should be eating in your diet and that way you can do a better job of monitoring it,0
so how about we meet back and say three to four weeks and we can kind of see how that journal is going so,0
yeah if you have any problems along the way before then feel free to give me a call I'm always available so if there is something that you find that's just not working just give me a call we can kind of discuss it but then we can meet in person because we really should probably have about a month of your journal you know kind of down but if there's something that comes up I mean by all means just give me a call there's my extension so you'll call me if you you know,0
yeah well I I would hope that with some you know with some exercise and with starting to be more aware by writing down what you eat you may find it as you have to write it down that you may find that you will avoid eating certain things because you don't want to you know as you write it down it may make you feel like well now I'm not so sure I should eat this like if you're gonna eat a whole container of ice cream you know you might not want to have to write that down so you may just limit yourself to a scoop or two of ice cream so there is some kind of pieces that help with having to write things down and I think we're just gonna take it step by step but again there's my phone and my extension so I'm here if you need me,0
so let's just continue on our conversation that's so Tonya I'm really glad you were able to kind of come in and just talk with me for a couple minutes as I explained kind of briefly on the phone as part of your insurance benefit I'm available for you as your own personal coach you know I am a nurse but I have a lot of background in wellness so I've been really here to help guide people and kind of as a case manager I'm able to help you there help empower you don't kind of work towards your goals of what you're trying to work on with your health and I know you would express on the phone a little bit but I would love it if you tell me some more about you know what is one of maybe the main things you've been thinking about in relation to your health right now,0
so the structure is really important to you in your life in order to manage your house,0
so it almost sounds like a house of cards if one kind of shifts away from from that,0
they just kind of all fall down very quickly and then you start to not feel good about yourself or you don't start to feel good in general physically,0
oh okay so because you start feeling poorly or you started feeling badly then you just kind of say well whatever or,0
for you it feels like this whole kind of circle of things almost the quickl you're not doing what you need to be doing then you start to feel a weight difference in your weight,0
so it just kind of builds on itself,0
so what do you see is the key goal that you're trying to focus on right now or maybe a group of goals what are what are your key things that you are wanting to have happen,0
Oh social physical activity,0
that you get to be out and be with people like,0
ust doing on your own right like even going to a gym and just being around other people working out we're going to some kind of exercise class just to be around other people who they're their general goal is to you know do physical tivity and feel better through it,0
yeah,0
yeah,0
yeah,0
yeah right now I realized that it would be this is just something I came to realization today so it would be about I think it's an eight,0
yeah it's really really up there,0
it's not a four or five right why would you say an eight not a four or five,0
oh okay it's about sharing there's that yeah really that piece of connectedness that's really important for you,0
so if we were to ask your second question and that's kind of where the rubber meets the road how confident are you that you could start finding a group activity let's say in the next two weeks,0
you could start one obviously you've got steps to find it,0
involved but within two weeks you could find yourself in some type of a group activity,0
so you would get that in ages yeah so it's something that's pretty important to you,0
definitely more than a six or seven and also you're really confident that you can go out there and do that,0
what do you see as some of the barriers that might get in your way,0
structuring your day better,0
so finding the time in your day,0
able to do or not do this or not,0
and how do you see that best in your day how do you see that working in like an evening kind of thing or,0
okay,0
so one of the things I hear people frequently will be saying is that the evenings my time to unwind and then I don't have the energy or I don't feel like going out to do something that might be more rigorous how is that for you,0
you can always have a cup of coffee,0
well it would be okay with you I would to touch base maybe after that class starts and just kind of see what you found how it's working and then we can go from there looking at any kind of barriers the one thing I think I would just encourage you with to normalize is to realize about doing things in small doable steps and not feeling like if you haven't done everything for the day that you're,0
the day but but that anymore water you drink or vegetables you've added it's certainly a positive and looking at trend,0
then to be hard on yourself right towards your you know movement toward wellness,0
okay so if we could touch base maybe in three weeks,0
that would be super I'd really look forward to it I'm really glad you came in,0
hi I'm Hannah I talked with you I knew the other day but I just wanted to touch base today you know about your softer situation I'm so I read your chart and I know tell that side are you still feeling depressed,0
a depressions and I know you feel like depressed now but I felt depressed before and it will pass like you'll get over it it's it's not that big a deal and so this depression why are you feeling depressed,0
oh wait wait sorry I did another note something else I wanted to ask you before no why or is that depression what brought you in here,0
oh yeah,0
yeah um okay so that overdose love to talk about um so then why are you feeling depressed,0
I looked in your chart and your life doesn't seem all that bad so this depression I think you can get over it um yeah let me like my notes here no song oh hey yeah can I talk to you later I'm gonna finish on there okay um sorry I lost my train of thought my my notes here you got booze overdose um so can you talk about these thoughts oh that like that area do you want to do um very still having those thoughts,0
no okay then great no that's because I know I mean if you're having them it's kind of like why I don't understand what people think of like it so it's really very weak them to do personally but any who is oh hold on a second hello no I'm at work right now yeah you know at Belmont yeah I want to talk with this patient here yeah I'll call you back okay okay all right yeah anyhoo so let me look at my notes but so you those thoughts were saying who are you saying about those did you have that I forget,0
no okay okay that's great I'm glad so are you feeling better than,0
so what do you think has worked in your therapy,0
one-on-one okay what do you want me to see if your doctors available I can totally arrange that,0
I'm going to go check that then right,0

hmm well I mean how confident would you say that you are right?,0
okay well what have you tried doing to lose the weight?,0
okay what activities specifically we have you tried to learn?,0
Oh didn't know you had an ankle pain but we can look at it later anyway um you know you're still going to need to do aerobic activities in order to lose the weight. it's proven to be the best way to ,0
well i'd say if your ankle pain doing brief walks every day maybe three or four and like take about  minutes at a time that should help you,0
well you know you should eat more fruits and vegetables you know green anything green and stick with short walks and the resistance training like you said it's going to help you with the weight loss okay well do any other questions for me today?,0
all right well I'll see you to follow up in two weeks thanks  ,0
no I don't,0
I know but that's part of it so I don't have to give you music you know what your lovemaking with Jason that was music to my ears,0
so how many times you guys have sex that night on a scale of one to five five being the lowest how many times did you guys have sex that night how many pieces of furniture,0
it was on the bed,0
are you were you a virgin before you would chase them no judgment you did go to private school,0
jobs count who you was being in college,0
just I have a hunch were you a lesbian in college,0
that's the hunch this this type of sex is actually very indicative of the type of relationship well if was it in conventional law was it like was ever done that or was it with her past was it slow was it you know you know what I'm talking about when I do that say stop cygwin let me win okay this is what we're gonna do I like to wrap up sessions with a game obvious this award Association have you heard of it,0
they're going to say the first thing that pops in your head hair,0
Redhead,0
penis the word association for penises penis okay as I think you're repressed,0
that is the first sign of oppression,0
how have you been?,0
good thanks for asking today we're going to start by just asking a few questions I was just  wondering how your home care has been  since the last time I saw you know? so  what type of products are you using to  clean your teeth and to help prevent the  build-up of plaque and bacteria and  stuff?,0
okay well that wasn't what I was  expecting here and I'm pretty  disappointed in your home care habits  that's not the proper way to care for  your teeth Oh as a professional and your  hygienist I need you to buy an electric  toothbrush because they remove way more  than your manual one I also need you to  brush twice a day and floss once a day  and use some type of toothpaste of  fluoride in it and lastly I really need  you to use a mouthwash to prevent the  build-up of bacteria and help print out  everything out of your mouth after  brushing and flossing ,0
well I know what I'm talking  about i went to school for two years to  get my degree and what I'm telling you  is really important if you want to try  to keep all of your teeth and not get  gingivitis or periodontal disease do you  not care about your health? ,0
you only have to swish for   seconds and then go  minutes  without food or water if you can't  handle that it's pretty embarrassing as  an adult here's my favorite it's  Listerine cool mint let me see you swish  for  seconds that way I know that you  know what to do with the product when  you get home and you can just keep that  to spit out whenever I tell you that the  time is up  is it burning? mm-hmm keep going almost  there okay you can go ahead and spit it  out into the cup thank you so is it bad?,0
well you have to go  minutes without it so  it'll go by fast okay and then i'm going  to give you this little mini bottle that  you can take home with you until you go  to the store to buy your own just make  sure it's this one cuz that one's really  going to clean your mouth the best even  though it burns a little bit okay just  remember it's the best for your help and  if you don't want to lose your teeth  then you're going to need to do that,0
Can I help you?,0
So you want nicotine replacement but you don't want to quit smoking?,0
"Yea, we don't really recommend that. The idea is that you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit so then you wouldn't be smoking at work but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either.",0
"Okay well smoking really is really bad for you, you know it causes things like lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease.",0
Oral disease.,0
"Well to be honest with you, you mentioned the patch, I can't recommend a patch to you if you're going to continue smoking that can actually be pretty dangerous for you. In order to advise you about this at all I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now.",0
Okay well we actually consider  cigarettes a day to be a significant amount and in fact I would then recommend to you that you start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement.,0
"Well there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings, then probably the gum would be the best option for you. It's not something that you would continue to use continuously throughout the day however but gum is something you use just when you have a craving.",0
"Well, we have that here but again but the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking.",0
Well.,0
"Aside from the gum you could try the nicotine lozenge that would be another option for you, again that's not something you wanna use continuously throughout the day. The nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement but again that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke.",0
you know you don't have to sign up if  you don't want to but you know kind of  here to like fix things for you and just  make sure everything goes no real  smoothly with the different issues that  you've been having and just kind of oh  you know kind of manage things and just  take care of stuff so you know it again  if you want the service you can have it  but it's kind of up to you but I am here  if you want me to be and you know I'll  couldn't kind of teach you about things  you might not know about or tell you  some things about your house and you  know just more or less make sure  everything goes okay so you know you  think that might be something you'd be  interested in wanting to be a part of  because I you know really like to help  you ,0
because it seems like I you  know you've expressed some health issues  lately and I know you've had a lot of  problems with your weight so that's  certainly something we can talk about  and I know a lot about you know weight loss and have helped a lot of people with you know managing their weight and figuring out what they need to do so you know what are your main problems about your weight I mean why is it a problem for you?,0
so why do you eat too much? I mean how is that a problem?,0
so you like it you just like eating food so you just kind of eat eat more than you know you should be eating yes like do you know about portion control has anyone told you about like you know a card size for a piece of meat or some salad I mean have you has anyone showed you that? because I can pull out our yeah yeah samples and give you those that ,0
you could tell me about it? I mean about what you should be eating for ya meet size and like you know baseball size for food so it's not that you don't know about you you you do know about poor iron control yeah so if you know how much you should be eating and then how is it a let me know if you know how much you should be eating then how do you stop?,0
well that's great i could do about this yeah because you know there's there's just so many different things when it comes to like weight loss you know and really being able to have some self control i mean that's a really really important factor this is really being able to have some self control and you know i found a lot of people just really need to increase their fruits and their vegetables and just not eat any processed foods and you know not need any anything that might be kind of junk but then you know not not cheat either i mean you want to be able let yourself have some ice cream or some things that you might really like from time to time because you know you don't want to completely not let yourself have good stuff either so ,0
oh I see well you know obviously you want to make sure you're not eating you know junk food all day long but on the other hand you want to make sure that you give yourself some opportunities to have that bite of brownie or cake or you know I for myself personally I really love like lemon meringue pie so I always have to you know save that little piece for myself in the fridge to make sure i have my little bite of lemon meringue pie and then i can feel good about you know where I where I was eating good the rest of the day then I could still have my lemon meringue pie so something like that might kind of work better you know for you to really take a look at your portion sizes and then you know making sure you get out there and exercising me if you're not exercising it certainly not going to help you with being able to get off the weight either so that's that's critical how are you doing on weight loss as far as exercising?,0
oh so see that's really key right that's a really key portion to it so it sounds like when we talk next time if you kind of kind of give me an idea maybe keep a journal for a week and tell me what you've been eating and we can really look at you know what good things that I can tell you what things you shouldn't be eating out of that plan and then I really think it'd be important if you just start maybe even just start walking three times a week if you could just start that really slowly and then months from now we can kind of see if that's helped some and we can talk about the items you've had on your journal and we can go from there all kind of direct you from there what you shouldn't be eating how does that sound?,0
sure what it was or whatever is comfortable for you so you know start out small so that you can feel really good about having some success in doing some exercise so you know if you feel tired at - minutes really just kind of paste it along for yourself and feel what's right so that you can feel like you're getting out there and getting moving because it's all about taking a small step and you know at least getting active okay and then I think the food journal would be really important because then we'll really have a better idea what you what you truly are eating and how many calories and then we can go from there I'm deciding you know how many calories you really should be eating in your diet and that way you can do a better job of monitoring it ,0
so how about we meet back and say three to four weeks and we can kind of see how that journals going? C	well that seems like a long time I mean I think in three to four weeks a lot of things can happen and I think these things come on it yeah ,0
if you have any problems along the way before then feel free to give me a call i'm always available so if there is something that you find it's just not working just give me a call we can kind of discuss it but then we can meet in person because we really should probably have about a month of your journal you know kind of down but if there's something that comes up I mean by Allah me just give me a call there's my extension so you'll call me if you you know my weights been coming up so ,0
well I I would hope that with some little you know with some exercise and with starting to be more aware by writing down what you eat you may find it as you have to write it down that you may find that you will avoid eating certain things because you don't want to you know as you write it down it may make you feel like well now I'm not so sure I should eat this like if you're going to eat them a whole container of ice cream you know you might not want to have to write that down so you may just limit yourself to scoop or two of ice cream so there is some kind of pieces that helps with having to write things down and I think we're just going to take it step by step but again there's my I'm phoning my extension so I'm here if you need me okay so let's just continue on our conversation that's so Tanya I'm really glad you're able to kind of come in and just talk with me for a couple minutes as i explained kind of briefly on the phone as part of your insurance benefit i'm available for you as your own personal coach you know i am a nurse but i have a lot of background in wellness so I've been really here to help guide people and kind of as a case manager I'm able to help you to help empower you don't kind of work towards your goals of what you're trying to work on with your health and I know you would expressed on the phone a little bit but I would love it if you tell me some more about you know what is one of maybe the main things you've been thinking about in relation to your health right now C	okay well basically I feel like if I don't if I don't stay on certain habits and routines then everything just kind of goes kaput ,0
so the structure is really important to you in your life in order to manage your health?,0
so it almost sounds like a house of cards if one kind of shifts away from from that hmm they just kind of all fall down very quickly and then you start to not feel good about yourself or you don't start to feel good in general physically?,0
oh okay so because you start feeling poorly or you start feeling badly then you just kind of say well whatever or ,0
for you it feels like this whole kind of circle of things almost cyclical and the fact if you're not doing what you need to be doing then you start to feel a weight difference in your weight yeah so it just kind of builds on itself ,0
so what do you see is the key goal that you're trying to focus on right now or maybe a group of gold what are what are your key things that you are wanting to have happen?,0
tell me a little bit about those ,0
a social physical activity yeah that you get to be out and be with people like yeah just doing on your own,0
so that you kind of feel like you're in a partnership together yeah that's rather than just your own yeah we aren't working toward this together as a group yeah so you've talked about several different kind of pieces that are important to you if we just took a look at that one activity because that sounds like a newer thing that you really need to push with where would you put yourself on how important this is to you want to say on a scale of one to ten? just just on importance ,0
okay it's about sharing is that yeah really that piece of connectedness that's really important for you yeah so if we were to ask your second question and that's kind of where the rubber meets the road how confident are you that you could start finding a group activity let's say in the next two weeks? oh that you could start one obviously that steps to find it I involved but within two weeks you could find yourself in some type of a group activity ,0
so you would get that in aid as yeah so it's something that's pretty important to you yeah I'm definitely more than a  and also you're really confident that you can go out there and do that yeah what do you see is some of the barriers that might get in your way? ,0
so finding the time in your day be able to do or not do this or not yeah and how do you see that best in your day how do you see that working in like an evening kind of thing around the evening? ,0
so one of the things I hear people frequently will be saying is that the evenings my time to unwind and then I don't have the energy or I don't feel like going out to do something that might be more rigorous how is that for you? ,0
well if it be okay with you I would love to touch base maybe after that class starts and just kind of see what you found how it's working and then we can go from there looking at any kind of barriers the one thing I think I would just encourage you with to normalize is to realize about doing things in small doable steps and not feeling like if you haven't done everything for the day that you are hailed the day but but that any more water you drink or vegetables you've added it's certainly a positive and look at my friend right then to be hard on yourself right towards your you know movement toward wellness right okay so if we could touch base maybe in three weeks sure that would be super I'd really look forward to it I'm really glad you came in okay thank you  ,0
finded life a bit anxious making just am I'm I'm working full time my husband's abroad okay my child's just left to go to university and I'm doing an online course and I really feel as if everything's getting on top of me and I felt like this once before about three or four years ago you'll you'll have it in your records and and you give me some tablets and not just helped me just get over the hump and I'm really thinking that I need some medication ,0
okay let's see your records that be sorry about two years ago roughly?,0
do remember the name of you tablets you got them? ,0
let's see it yeah you got  tablets at that point ,0
but you're working now is that right?,0
is ok?,0
you're sleeping well? ,0
you eating fine concentrations good core memory is good?,0
is that why you're not looking after yourself as well at the moment?,0
and alcohol?,0
with glasses how much do you mean?,0
two of those? yeah okay and you wanting tablets?,0
we've no Rini to follow guidelines and recommendations on how they've had just had recently updated guidelines we use things like nice guidelines and stuff and you're describing anxiety symptoms that seem to be related to specific issues and we don't think tablets are the best thing anymore we're there's much more recommendation to big you know talking with professionals having what we call CBT cognitive behavioral therapy working through these issues is probably a better long-term option and is what is firstly recommended and second recommendation we try and avoid especially those types of drugs you're talking about valium because we know they just make addicted to them ,0
it's a psychologist to talk to you about you how things you do ,0
it's usually our obsessions in a seminar if you're lucky once a week that week wicked ,0
you don't have anyone any of them left yet still we finished all those you had? C	two years ago yes yep she took all than one then when I needed them yet and that was fine that was all I needed though you gave me I think  tablets that was all I needed just to get me over the hump nope just about - weeks ,0
still think be worth having a more in-depth discussion about this to see what would be your best options because I other tablets as well that can be used again there again more preventative it's more to keep these things getting so it doesn't happen again and again and again right and also your ways of coping assume does it ,0
it depends a bit on different areas where is it you live just locally here don't you yeah i would have to send a letter and we would get a reply to tell us how long you'd have to wait and i would hope it would be too long because this is one of our prioritized areas and it how long is too long what i should be within the month i would take a month yeah ,0
well i definitely when you give you that many and i really think you'll be worth looking at the other options how about i gave you just a few like a couple to see if that does you a little better than it ,0
no I think no I think we should refer your straightaway ,0
I'll give you a few tablets I'll give you a few tablet and we'll refer you because I need you don't have to come back here unless there is a problem ,0
do you think it's going to last that long?,0
i can do you affect your driving light over they dictate just as a short bar so it was won by suppose if that's your day I'm saying well I think you know that beam in between we can give you a couple of times now to try for the next few days I'll send a referral today and obviously if you feel so better you can come back but I would hope you wouldn't need to ask okay let just to do check here as well computers reminding me that you ever do you smear as well that we will as well yep you know we have targets we need to read targets yeah so worth getting them done ,0
was that somewhere else then? because that might not be recorded here no is good something here ,0
that was done we need to do that every three or five years I've got that has been done that's okay and for the smear it's not being recorded here did you get a letter with the result? if you do member we could be good records that way no it's not going to do any harm getting an extra one so make the point with the nurse right the time the ,0
okay i'll just write the description ,0
thank you see you  ,0
It calms your nerves and makes you feel good.,0
"OK Ms. Fisher listen to this, by continuing to smoke you are putting your body in a great amount of harm COPD, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma, all these other type of bad things. You know so why haven't you quit yet?",0
I don't understand. What's so tough about it? Can't you understand that you are putting your body at great harm by continuing to smoke?,0
You guess so. OK so good. So that means you want to quit now right?,0
"OK, good, good I'm glad to hear you say that. So this is what were gonna do. First, were gonna set a quit date. Next, I want you to go home and remove all the cigarettes in your surroundings. Like, as soon as you leave here. And then finally, I'm gonna give you this prescription for Chantix which you can take every day, and also these nicotine patches. Ok.",0
"Ok, alright good. We'll set an appointment for you to come see me in another month. When we see you in another month you need to have quit smoking cigarettes because you know how bad it is for you. Alright? Alright, you can pick up the prescription from my nurse on your way out and then call me at the clinic if you have any questions. OK. Thank you so much it was good seeing you again. OK, Alright. Take care. Bye ",0
hi pharmacists I have some questions that I really need to speak to someone about ,0
yeah pharmacist go ahead ,0
well the measles is a really bad infection so it's really important you need to give your son the vaccinations ,0
it doesn't matter if your son's always healthy vitamins don't treat the measles  ,0
okay so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aidan that should help with the ear infection but in looking through this chart I mean it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so that's really a big problem ,0
well one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections and kids is actually smoke exposure are you smoking?,0
well the fact that he's having these ear infections is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke and so what can you tell me about that?,0
I really need you to quit smoking both for your health and for Aidan did you know smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections it could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here also things like vitamin C do efficiency cavities like dental cavities behavior problems asthma other upper respiratory infections it's really putting him at a lot of risk in addition to that kids of smokers end up smoking themselves you want him to grow up to be a smoker?,0
well now is the time to quit it's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking not only for him like I said but also for you you're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer for emphysema for oral cancers for heart disease for all kinds ,0
well there's all kinds of things you can use now it's not as hard as it used to be you can use nicotine replacement there's patches there's lozenges there's gum there's the inhaler there's nasal spray we can talk about medications you can try chantix you can try zyban there's quit smoking groups you can go to there's hotlines you can talk ,0
no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit this is really important ,0
well what can be more important to you than the health of your child?,0
I really need you to tell me that you're gonna quit smoking this is really important ,0
okay well I think you really need to think about this seriously it like I said it's really putting yourself and your child in danger ,0
okay okay  ,0
hi I'm here to pick up description ,0
okay and is it for Molly?,0
hi ,0
how are you doing?,0
well would you mind taking a seat I have a couple things I want to go over with you about this medication,0
okay well this should only take a few minutes. so before we get started I just want to make sure I still got all the correct information so you're still on Emma Street with the same phone number and everything right?,0
okay so nothing's changed wonderful. um now I was taking a look at your medication profile earlier and it looks like you're on two different strengths of lipitor so that obviously it can't be right ,0
okay so do you remember which one you're taking?,0
okay I think you're taking the  milligram tablets it's not right ,0
"so the doctor gave you this new prescription but there's new medication, is that right?",0
okay okay so this medication is for your cholesterol,0
and you're going to take it once a day it's really important that you take it every day all right and you can take it with or without food it doesn't really matters ,0
okay and now the doctor did tell you this was your cholesterol right? ,0
"right right exactly so that's why he wrote you this prescription so it's greater cholesterol you're just gonna take it once a day it's really easy. Okay, there are some side effects that go along with this medication but I wouldn't really worry about it because I mean you're young you're healthy it's not an issue so don't concern yourself with it. Okay all right so just to make sure that I didn't miss anything I'm just gonna repeat everything again to make sure you got it first time okay all right so this medication is for your cholesterol you're gonna take it once a day you can take it with a lot of water and you want to make sure you don't miss any doses okay okay ",0
what questions do you have any questions at all?,0
well if that's it I guess you can go ahead now so here's your prescription,0
all right have a nice day  ,0
and how does that make you feel,0
and why are you concerned,0
wait you read her diary why would you read her diary that is her,0
well first of all if she was hanging out with this boy she wouldn't be,0
oh,0
just stop because that is not what you're supposed to do going,0
I just can't even I have phone call to think alright,0
hi Laura so thanks for coming in I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about so basically I'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester and we're gonna talk about you know whatever's kind of going on in your life I'll ask you some questions about you know your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of things and then we'll talk a little bit about you know different behaviors and and stuff like that and so it's it's pretty casual pretty informal just sort of a chance for me to get to know you,0
okay why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself,0
okay and what do you like to do for fun,0
and when you and your friends are hanging out and what do you do go to ball games go to party,0
okay and what kind of hobbies do you have,0
what are your plans for after high school,0
that's great what do you think you'll study,0
Oh neat,0
yeah that's great that's a really good goal,0
it's a hard work to get into law school are you doing school what kind of grades do you get,0
okay what classes are you not getting A's and B's in,0
oh,0
okay and do you know where you're going to apply to college,0
okay cool and and what made you decide maybe law school or journalism,0
okay great sounds like you have like I said really good goals and you're working hard in school you said that when you're going out with your friends you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties so do you drink alcohol,0
okay and how often do you think you drink,0
mm-hmm so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol,0
okay and so that's maybe like 20 times a year,0
so that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then,0
okay what do you thinks the most you've ever had,0
but you've been drunk before,0
okay so the most you've ever ever had is two drinks in a day,0
okay interesting so do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol,0
okay so one of the things that you know it's really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving so you know that's actually a really big problem and and even around here we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident so that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing all right have you ever done that have you ever done,0
okay how much do your friends drink,0
okay,0
what about at these parties you're going to there are other kids there who are drinking a lot,0
and do you hang out with them,0
mm-hmm so you know even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk did you know that,0
yeah so there I mean a lot of the other dangers of drinking like not just car accidents we can have other accidents you know people you know will fall or you know break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and fallen down or you know as a girl it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted,0
you know especially if you've been drinking then you know you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you did have you thought about that,0
and then you know people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too also you know there have been a lot of kids even at this school gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook and then their parents find out or school finds out and you know we have a no tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol and really can get you into trouble and could put your whole college career in jeopardy have you thought about that,0
but you're still drinking,0
so I mean do you think it's the thing to do if you want to be an attorney,0
okay hmm so I mean I guess what we need to do then is kind of talk about some goals for how to be safer,0
um obviously you shouldn't be drinking at all um what do you think about that,0
so do you think you can quit,0
okay so I'm gonna write down then that you've decided to quit,0
and that's going to be your goal and that's great you know that's really why we're here is to talk about that and make sure that you come to that decision um so I guess can you quit this weekend then,0
okay and then what about your friends who are still drinking,0
okay and what if they won't,0
yeah probably if your friends won't quit drinking you should just find new friends because you know the problem is if they're drinking they're going to pressure you into drinking and then you're going to feel awkward and you know you're going to be stuck and and not know what to do and really just be better off probably without them if they're if they're the kind of people who are going to keep drinking they're probably not a good influence,0
and then then you'll be better set for college too because you know the issue is you're getting good grades now but when you get to college it's a lot harder and you know if you're needing really good grades to get into law school which you will need then you really can't be distracted by alcohol,0
okay so um that's great because it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you um let's see I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking,0
okay so yeah just another reason why you probably need to just quit then um okay yeah okay so like I said I'm gonna write down here that you've decided to quit and you know I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably next semester sometime so we can kind of check in and make sure that you know that's still going well and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here,0
okay um any questions or,0
okay you're sure okay all right um well that's probably it then you can head back to class and and thanks for coming in,0
Hi Emily how are you,0
I'm good um Wow what's changed what do we have here,0
Emily why why did you get your lip pierced,0
gorgeous your teeth are lovely you do not need a piercing,0
do you know what those oral piercings can do to your teeth,0
well yes except that you know what's going to happen see how do you feel how when you're moving your lips smile for me okay so do you see how when your muscles are moving that piercing is rubbing against your gums as well as your teeth so we can see some recession that's going to start to happen,0
possibly affecting the tooth itself chipping the tooth etc so it's something that we definitely don't like to see,0
well it's only been a month,0
okay orderly days yet and it might not be a bad idea to reconsider the piercing,0
Emily I've been seeing you for so long and you know that I really just I think you have lovely teeth and I've watched you you know just mature etc and I hate I'd hate to see you wreck your teeth for something like this I really would,0
all right all right okay okay okay we'll continue the exam but you know where I stand on this okay,0
all right,0
I understand that your asthma symptoms have been just really out of control so we need to look at some of the ways that you can get healthy and not be back here again ,0
well you sound a bit surprise by that but I'm sure that you've see some of the material that that the clinic gave you about as with symptoms and managing your asthma and pets are a really big source of problems when that respect,0
well wait a second Sal what do you mean you you have...? if you as an you know to be informed about I'm just really taken aback by that because I understand from your chart that you have a young baby a new baby,0
and you are very concerned about your health you want to be there for your baby and that you've already taken some steps you've almost quit smoking which is fantastic so the next step is to really deal with the dog deal with the pet I know it's it's gonna be hard to do that but there are always people who will adopt animals I'm sure that you have friends or family members ,0
Sal it's you that I'm worried about okay the symptoms are worse you've had two or three major asthma attacks and do you appreciate how this is a risk to your life that there are some some adults with severe asthma who actually can die as a result of their symptoms it truly is something to take very very seriously I can't emphasize that enough,0
Sal what do you understand that what happened six years ago or ten years ago your asthma is progressively getting worse you know very well that the puffers the strength of the medication is getting higher and higher and there's only so much that can be done with medication alone you know this,0
so you're almost on the strongest one and if Oscar is that important to you then do you put Oscar higher than your baby than your wife like that makes no sense to me do you understand how important this is?,0
good morning is really nice that you've come along to see me to talk about stopping smoking what have you got in mind what you want from us,0
absolutely when the right place for that,0
okay what just remind me in why is you want to stop,0
good and severe depression here,0
so that can't feel like I'm comfortable being myself so that sounds like one of the reasons you have to quit is it's all getting smelly and it's getting see any other reasons um,0
seven pounds a week or,0
forty,0
could really quit we even my math you see okay so we're talking about spec fifty couldn't we being one of the few left smoggy in your crowd and not liking the smell that sounds like three reasons do you think that's enough to make you say goodbye to cigarettes eight okay so have you got a date in mind when you like to stop smoking,0
generally it works well if you find a time when you're not under a huge amount of other stresses and strains one of the main reasons why you actually smoke what you enjoy most about,0
do you think you'll be supposed about the,0
sort of stresses,0
does your favorite cigarette the day,0
at the end of the day I think that helps you just online put an end to the work section and move into your own time,0
okay so after you've had the quit date what do you think you might do when is the first day at work it's time if you're not gonna cigarette,0
how do you manage to stop sneaking in the past,0
what got you back it was,0
remember it says I make just how many I sort of took you back into right let me just make sure I've understood what's going on here you really want to sort of thinking with this we kind of the last guy in your group still smoking it costs a lot of money and you don't be like smell the main reason that you smoke is because at the end of the day gives you the kind of relaxation and there's quite a little stress is going on which you're using cigarettes to help you cope with what you like to do is stop and you'd like to sort of choose a time to quit when it's going to be there's not as much stress around as possible when do you think would be a good time for you to choose to being your quit date okay,0
Monday morning after party really good day that's next week okay now one of the things that we do the pharmacy is recommended medication to help you know this increases your chance of success and it makes it more likely come along a lot of people make using nicotine replacement therapy which comes in a variety of formats like patches gum you probably seen people using any of these products and other options are tablets which you can get from the GP local champion again so have you something in mind that you might like to use to help you through managing the cravings,0
okay so patches I think you've already seen them again I'll get some out and I'll show you what they look like this course of medication lasts for ten to twelve weeks and we strongly recommend that we will stay on the whole course of medication and that that gives you the best chance of success stopping smoking is not easy but it's and when the type of support we offer here in the pharmacy you absolutely make your chance of success for x greater than try on your own so that's why it's really good that you come to see me you said that you really want to do it and then next week sounds like a good day for you to start because the party's opened up with you've got the time at the end of the day when you finish work which might be the first time you've gone without a cigarette so what I like to recommend is that you use two products perhaps and I'm thinking of you having a patch and then suggesting that you might use something that you can top up with often a person who smokes that's exactly what it feels like when they're craving for cigarette what does it feel like to you thing that you want one,0
okay and that's exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I'm looking to stop happen to you so I would strongly recommend that you have the patch talk about how to use it and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when any of those feelings of irritation coming out that typically in that first week so you're happy with the date for me okay would you like to come back and see me again other and what would you like me to do if you don't come back,0
come on ,0
how can I help you t well ,0
Reducto I think that's what it was colleges and reduct I'll actually is no longer recommended and for usin in we lost weight control have you been getting on with it?,0
you can buy em over the counter Laura doors lower doors tablets eat so you don't need a prescription for them anymore ,0
I'm sorry we can't prescribe orlistat ,0
because it's over-the-counter medicines right ,0
we can't we can't prescribe anything reductil was the one that was on I was prescription on the medicine and we can no longer prescribe that guidance recommends that we no longer prescribe that for people because it's actually shown to increase the cardiovascular risk and actually I noticed from your last visit that your blood pressure was a little bit high I don't think you should be taking any medicines because the bottom line is actually from what you're telling me is it's not helping you to lose weight it's helping you to maintain your read and maintaining your weight should be something that you do through diet and exercise anyway this is artificially maintaining your weight ,0
it has actually been recent gaiden so in the last month or so after six weeks tips sometimes tease a bit to filter through but we've been told unequivocally that we're not allowed to prescribe this anymore your prescription to farm since they won't fill it and you really do need to be joining Weight Watchers there's been an article there's been an article in the in the BMG just a couple of weeks ago that shows are actually joining a group a Weight Watchers group or the equivalent is much more effective long-term well I'm sorry there's no choice yeah it's a much lower it's much more it because it's less there's less and drug in it it's less effective but then consequently it's also less dangerous so you can buy them orlistat and or you can join Weight Watchers you actually,0
I can appreciate that what it's your diet and exercise that's the important thing you need to get yourself sorted out I don't eat them all well I think you might find that you possibly are eating more than you think and if you join Weight Watchers or equivalent slimming world etc then you possibly would be encouraged to do a food diet e and you might find that you're eating more than you there's nothing more I can do for you we cannot prescribe reductil anymore the recommendation is join a Weight Watchers group or Slimming World Group and just modify your diet and increase your exercise that is the only way that you are going to lose weight,0
well that is the recommendation that's the guidelines if you're very welcome to go and make an appointment with another doctor but you will get the same message from them as you're getting from me and I'm uh sorry if I peered unsympathetic however the bottom line is diet and exercise is what you need to do in order to lose weight and to maintain your weight ,0
if you're on if you're on a stool that you've always done then you're always going to get what you get so if you already eat and you've already used to be fat but the only reason that you're maintaining your weight is because of the deductr ,0
no I'm saying that you need to be looking at your whole lifestyle which is dying exercise I'm really sorry that i'm unable to help you today please feel free to make an appointment with another GPA ,0
thank you  ,0
Jim Cup hi I why are you stuff in my office all right Jim so what brings you in today ,0
all right listen up you got to make some big lifestyle changes you need be decreasing your so do you need to be an angry teasing potassium increasing magnesium cutting all that saturated fat your diet looks horrible right now I mean you're you're hardly doing anything right Jim you're going to end up just like your dad if you don't change right now you have to change Jim ,0
"However, I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth. Actually, if you look up here... the roof of your mouth, I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use. And you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user, so...",0
I'm just wondering what's going on.,0
"OK. Well, as I said, there's a lot of irritation. In particular, like I was mentioning, up here in the roof of your mouth, it's turned really deathly white colored, and there's little red spots, and you probably didn't notice cause we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth. But you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth, which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health. It's called, Nicotinex Domotitus, and this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco. So, maybe you're not smoking cigarettes. Are you smoking a pipe? Or cigars? Or, is there something else that..",0
"Could be contributing to this, because I don't know what else might be causing it.",0
Mmm hmm.,0
Mmm hmm.,0
Uh huh.,0
"OK. So, I think that's a pretty common misconception, because they're fruit flavored, people think they're OK. Those are really bad for you. Did you know that?",0
"Right. They're still cigars. And they're still tobacco. And so, they still cause lung cancer, oral cancer, emphysema. All those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarettes.",0
This is really important.,0
"Uh huh. Well, that's, I mean, at least you're not doing that. So, that's good. But it's still causing a lot of problems, and as I said, I can see the... the evidence in the roof of your mouth. You're causing some serious damage. And this needs to stop.  Have you thought about quitting?",0
What do you mean?,0
"So, you're gonna quit then?",0
"What do you mean, maybe? I just told you how bad it is for you. It's messing up your mouth. You're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases. This is really important. You need to quit.",0
"What's there to think about? You said it's not, that... something you do all that often. Um, there's all these negative side effects. There's all these risks that you're putting yourself in.",0
"OK, well that's a good start, but cutting back isn't gonna do it. If you actually quit the smoking, you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth, and you can stop yourself from... from being at risk for these other diseases. But, but as long as you're continuing to use these cigars, you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger.",0
"You're choosing to really damage your mouth, and actually it can cause problems with your teeth, too. I don't know if you've noticed your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before. That's another side effect. There are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use. Whether it's cigarettes, cigars, dip, chews, snuffs, snus, hookah, any of it. This is a really important decision that you're making, and you said it's your choice, but you're really choosing to make yourself sick, and potentially die.",0
"Well, I appreciate you thinking about it. I hope you'll think about it really hard. You know, this is something that I'm gonna continue to ask you about, because it's something that really needs to change. ",0
come in hey doctor hello how are you today?,0
right no no no no what when was the last time you got that prescription from us?,0
yes I'm surprised did you see the local GP?,0
you shouldn't have been given a doctor why do you think you need that?,0
no no no you can't you you can't get that drug anymore I'm afraid no no you're not having that drug anymore and it's been proven that that drug is not good for you and so I'm very surprised that the look and gave it to you but we're not doing it anymore yes but it's not it's not fine it's not good for your heart it's causing heart problems and it's been proven that it's not the most effective way to lose sweet and what what are you doing about your lifestyle? what are you doing about losing weight? other than depending on tablets?,0
well it's going to take a bit more than that I think and have you thought about planning in advance? if you work you know taking a packed lunch pre planning your meals and turning to healthy options? because really even diet cooks not good for you you should be replacing that with water ,0
yeah but I roll the other doctors overweight no no so clearly you could be improving your lifestyle you could take a wrap and just have it you know you could make a wrap a healthy wrap and take it and just have it instead of reaching for a bar of chocolate because i'll also affect your blood pressure and your sugar levels so and what I think you should maybe do as maybe just have a maybe do a diet e of your lifestyle because well it's a no popping a pill seems like an easy option but really you're going to have to do the hard work this is only going to come if you get in the right headspace and you start looking at your lifestyle looking at your exercise looking at your eating habits looking at the frequency and your magnet you're eating because if you're running about as a doctor you shouldn't beginning we if you if you've got a busy lifestyle you should be losing weight naturally so you're there must be something in your daily routine that's stopping you so you maybe need to look and see if you're a comfort eater or what what your triggers are for food and and get that sorted but you know I'm afraid drugs are no longer the answer C	I'll just get one half down to the last few months of my job and then ,0
no I know I you know we would all like a magic wand because it makes life easier but I can't do that it's not worth the risk to your heart I can't I can't do that you just need to take a long hard look at yourself and what you're doing and if you want help with that we do have pamphlets you know have you thought about and you know doing some exercise that you feel more energized ,0
so you need to put some thought into if you is that is your lifestyle you're going to have to put some thought into when you can devote some time to looking after yourself ,0
so are you putting on weight or have you been losing the weight?,0
so you've not you've not been losing weight with it? C 	that's being okay yeah I probably should put on weight of an that's been using it yeah,0
so you can't you know it's good that you're standing still but it's not good that you're not losing weight especially if you're on the drugs so clearly the drug wasn't the answer for you and really the only answer for you as its lifestyle changes and you know look at your colleagues and are they what are they eating and adopt some of their policy Asian was there eating on the hoof they must there must be some of your colleagues that are eating healthy options that you could you could take a flask of soup you know I'm soup salads wraps fruit and veg you know that's that's the only way is the hard way but it's the only way yeah ,0
that's why I think you need to control of it yourself by planning and making sure that you have healthy options available because otherwise you're just going to stay in a vicious cycle and and you know drugs we would all like a drug to me things easy for us but I'm afraid easy it's not the option it's going to be a hard slog but I think I think you'll find that once you start if you get yourself into the right headspace once you start then you will have a sense of achievement and the wheat will start loose it you will start losing the week because if you're that energetic in your job you're obviously doing enough activity so it has to be down to the diet ,0
but why don't you make a diary of everything that you eat? because you might not realize I had you might be grazing and not realizing it so why don't you keep a food diary and come back and see me and two weeks time can you keep a diet have you got k cubed I you for two weeks?,0
if you write down everything that you eat and any extra activity other than running a boat in your jobs that you do and we'll look at that and where you now before you go and will we when you come back and then we'll see if you can start making a conscious effort and then we'll maybe set you down with a dietician set you up with an appointment with the dietitian to get some nutritional advice but I think you need to start preparing yourself mentally and to be in the right headspace to make this work for you because if you're not in the right frame of mind if you're doing it grudgingly then you're not going to lose weight,0
hi my name is Cambridge I was a pharmacist I see you're taking a lot of medications what do you have the time to walk through them with?,0
okay so I see that you're taking simvastatin amlodipine and sertraline I know this is kind of a lot of medications what patients have a lot issues taken all those medications dude do you ever miss a dose or how do you take them?,0
what you missed doses?,0

well there's a lot of things we can do to kind of help you make sure you keep taking your doses it's a pretty important are you aware of like some of the benefits that always be on your dosage and taking them regularly has? ,0

I know and work can make a dental  appointment difficult yeah,0
I see which makes a dental  visit almost impossible it sure does  could you talk to your boss about it?,0
So what do you think will help,0
you know we do have some  appointments that are later in the  afternoon and we have appointments early  in the morning or I could give you a  referral ,0
but the  baby teeth are really important for for  eating and for speech development and to  help ensure that the permanent teeth  come in properly ,0
so tell me what  you're thinking about the baby teeth,0
you're right nutrition is important but  the baby teeth are also important in  speech and in space maintenance and just  in helping the kids feel better about  the way they look ,0
right it's all about  prevention so what would you like to do  now?,0
That's really a problem.,0
"Well, one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections in kids is actually smoke exposure. Are you smoking?",0
"Well, the fact that he's having these ear infections, is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke. And so, what can you tell me about that?",0
"I really need you to quit smoking. Both for your health and for Aiden.  Do you know, smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections,  it could get to the point where he'll have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here. Also things like vitamins C deficiency, cavities, like dental cavities, behavior problems, um, asthma, other upper respiratory infections. It's really putting him at a lot of risk. In additions to that, kids of smokers end up smoking themselves. Do you want him to grow up to be a smoker?",0
"Well, now's the time to quit. It's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking. Not only for him, like I said, but also for you. You're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer, for Emphysema, for oral cancers, for heart disease. For all kinds of things.",0
"Well, there's all kinds of things you can use know. It's not as hard as it used to be. You can use nicotine replacement. There's patches, there's lozenges, there's gum. There's the inhaler. There's  nasal spray. We can talk about medications. You can try Chantix, you can try Zyban. There's quit smoking groups  you can go to. There's hotlines you can call ...",0
There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit. This is really important.,0
"Well, what can be more important to you than the health of your child?",0
I really need you to tell me that you're gonna quit smoking. This is really important.,0
"OK, well I think you really need to think about this seriously. Like I said, it's really putting yourself and your child in danger.",0
OK ,0
hi I'm the pharmacist how can I help you,0
you've been here before?,0
okay um so so this is a new prescription?,0
no problem I'm just going to ask you a few other questions before I fill this prescription okay do you have any allergies no any medical conditions? ,0
any other medications you're taking? ,0
okay well let me just counsel you on this medication  ,0
so there anything else we can help you with today Jeff before we go ,0
great what I'd like to do just before you go is your recall in your reception the receptionist gave you a questionnaire to fill in ,0
I just like to talk to you about their she enters it in the computer and I see from the way you filled it in we at the moment from a perspective of your health will classify your physical activity is inactive ,0
inactive so at the moment I'm like we're going to ,0
perhaps what I could tell you is looked at the moment the current recommendation for health is that everybody should do  minutes of moderate exercise at least five days that the week that's to benefit their head I fleets you mean now everybody,0
what's really important is particularly as somebody your age is you're really entering that age where we really need to think about heart disease diabetes,0
that's that's how we'd like to keep it of course and if you were to exercise at that level what we know is you half your risk of getting heart disease having high blood pressure getting diabetes gaining weight etc and of course my concern is that you're healthy at the moment we keep you there ,0
what we really need to discuss is how we can get you to be a bit more physically active start moving this along a little bit ,0
so you do a lot of things but from where you feel this in you really don't do enough physical activity to benefit your help or ,0
I understand that you're on the go all the time but what's really important is no more that you protect your health now imagine running your business if you're held in the dark deteriorate ,0
and that's the way we'd like to keep it of course and what I'm really concerned about is all men of your age of my age is our health now is at a point where it starts to you know we have to think about heart disease and things like diabetes and one really good way of protecting ourselves this is to be physically active well we'll go around in circles it because i would say i am particularly active well,0
well if you think about that recommendation that any equivalent if you like of walk in two to three miles an hour a day at a fairly fast pace there are things equivalent to that not just being on the go that's you know marching rather than strolling mm-hmm,0
well ideally this is something to do every day this is kind of a minimum amount of physical activity,0
well one of the things i should tell you about is that not doing this so not doing much physical activity does really increase this one of the most important risk factors for heart disease for some cancers colon cancer that affects many men and for elevated blood pressure all the things that we see are getting common in men as they get older start to become more risky if we avoid physical activity ,0
so it's a genuine concern and obviously part of my job is to let you know about my concern and make sure you've got the right information to make decisions about your health and this is one of the important things you can't ,0
well the good news is you don't have to do it all in one gut you can do  minutes in the morn in  minutes at lunch time and ten minutes of an evening that would still lead to important health benefits I see anything in the bigger scheme of things is  minutes investment in your health worth it ,0
oh because the evidence tells us it really is an important risk factor similar in the way that smoking is we know now obviously everyone takes it as a bit of given that smoking's not really a good thing to do for their health and we're realizing that physical activity is the same avoiding physical activity is as much of a risk to your health as smoking is  C;	well well what else could I do ,0
well I'd like you to really give some thought to doing a good brisk walk in the mornings every day and again in the evenings and you turn me walking around the factory is not enough ,0
well I suspect I don't know of course but I suspect it's not really the equivalent of a good March for ten continuum minutes ,0
well I try like you I've got a busy job and we're always on call etc but i do really try and fit in a good strong walk every day does that mean you do it every day most days most days I do,0
I think I do really think it's very important for you ,0
I think you'd be surprised how much difference it made and indeed when you're at work I suspect you know it'll help with the energy you have for that busy job and in the long term it yeah one way to think about it it's a real investment in the future ,0
Jeff family Jeff ,0
so you can imagine at some point in the future you know you don't want to be in a situation where you you know want to play with the grandchildren for example and you can't because you simply unfit ,0
but you see my point ,0
you don't want your lack of fitness no I mean how you behind on you know of course that I supply golf but I doubt the time these days mm-hmm take ,0
you have been fitter ,0
so you think that's something you could do again ,0
yes if you do it briskly mm-hmm this is ,0
yeah well walk walking briskly does lead to very substantial health benefits yeah and,0
when do you think you will do something,0
ok so deal then mm-hmm when we should start doing that geez ,0
then you're going to do  minutes of brisk walking today give it a try ,0
why don't you and I meet again in a month mmm take stop and you can tell me what you found out yeah and then we'll have another chat about it then ok all right we'll do that ok alright fair enough thanks Jeff see you again in a month  ,0
hi Emily how are you?,0
I'm good um Wow what's changed? what do we have here?,0
Emily why why did you get your lip pierced why? I don't wanted to change and you can kind of cool gorgeous your teeth are lovely you do not need a piercing,0
then do you know what those oral piercings can do to your teeth?,0
well yes except that you know what's going to happen see how do you feel how when you're moving your lips smile for me okay so do you see how when your muscles are moving that piercing is rubbing against your gums as well as your teeth? so we can see some recession that's going to start to happen yeah possibly affecting the tooth itself chipping the tooth etc so it's something that we definitely don't like to see ,0
well it's only been a month yeah okay orderly days yet and it might not be a bad idea to reconsider the piercing ,0
I mean Emily I've been seeing you for so long and you know that I really just I think you have lovely teeth and I've watched you you know just mature etc and I hate I'd hate to see you wreck your teeth for something like this I really would ,0
all right okay okay okay we'll continue the exam but you know where I stand on this okay all right all right  ,0
finish the exam have some good news and they have some not-so-good news looks like you don't have any cavities so that's the good news,0
however I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth actually if you look up here a roof of your mouth I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use and you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user so I'm just wondering what's going on ,0
okay well as I said there's a lot of irritation in particular like I was mentioning up here in the roof of your mouth it's turned really deathly white colored and there's little red spots and you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health it's called nicotinic stomatitis and this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco so maybe you're not smoking cigarettes are you smoking a pipe or cigars or is there something else they will be contributing to this because I don't know what else might be causing it ,0
so I think that's a pretty common misconception because they're fruit flavored people think they're okay those are really bad for you did you know that I'm ,0
right there still cigars and there's still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer oral cancer emphysema all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarettes ,0
well that's I mean at least you're not doing that so that's good but it's still causing a lot of problems and as I said I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth you're causing some serious damage and this needs to stop have you thought about quitting ,0
what do you mean ,0
so you're going to quit then oh,0
what do you mean maybe I just told you how bad it is for you it's messing up your mouth you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases this is really important you need to quit,0
what's there to think about you said it's not that something you do all that often I'm there's all these negative side effects there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in,0
okay well that's a good start but cutting back isn't going to do it if you actually quit the smoking you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth and you can stop yourself from from being at risk for these other diseases but as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger ,0
you're choosing to really damage your mouth and actually it can cause problems with your teeth too I don't know if you notice your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before that's another side effect there are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use whether it's cigarettes cigars dip to snuff snooze who got any of it this is a really important decision that you're making and you said it's your choice but you're really choosing to make yourself sick and potentially die ,0
well I appreciate you thinking about I hope you'll think about it really hard you know this is something that I'm going to continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change  ,0
okay so I'm just going to ask you a couple more background questions do you use any tobacco products or smoke cigarettes ,0
okay how about in the last year ,0
okay and how often do you have a drink containing alcohol ,0
okay so it sounds like you're drinking about four times a week anywhere between three and eight drinks on a given day so maybe around  drinks a week ,0
okay do you use any street drugs like any marijuana cocaine heroin,0
do you ever use any prescription medicines that were not prescribed for you or ever use your own prescriptions in a way in which they were not prescribed ,0
okay so you know as we said before you're drinking it sounds like you're drinking about  drinks a week over the course of a few days and I did want to point out to you that the recommended limit for women is actually no more than seven drinks a week and no more than three on a given day so you're doing more than that right now and when you drink more than this amount it puts you at risk for a number of things ,0
things like greater risk of injury damage to different parts of your body just a bunch of different problems and so I'm going to recommend that you cut down to cut down that amount to the recommended limit again that's no more than seven drinks a week and no more than  in a given day do you think you could do that would that be a good goal for you ,0
yeah I know that making changes isn't always easy but when you more than what's recommended it creates problems you know you said you hurt your ankle and came out of the bar this time,0
well it's possible you strained your ankle as a result of the alcohol you know it can actually affect your balance and stability so really you know for where you are right now you're drinking a good amount more than what's recommended and you know I want you to be healthy and I don't want to see you coming back in here for something else so I'm really going to recommend that you try to cut down to that amount so do you think you could do that cut down to no more than three drinks in a given day,0
so it sounds like you know the amount you drink is pretty normal amongst the people you typically drink with but these limits are they're actually recommended for all adults and studies have shown that when you drink more than this it creates a bunch of problems like we talked about so you know why do you think you drink the amount you drink ,0
well I think it can still have fun with in these amounts so that's what I'm going to recommend I think this is a really good goal and hopefully we won't see any more injuries,0
okay so why don't you try that ,0
all right thank you so much  ,0
alright Chris so I need to talk to you because as you know we have a zero tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school and as as athletic director it's my job to check in with our student athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule and I've been hearing some chatter from some other kids about party this weekend and from what I hear where you were there and you know I can't confirm or deny anything so I'm not at the point where i can give you consequences but i do want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how you know you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams right?,0
yeah I get it like it we've all been there okay you know I was in high school once too you know I drank too I get it there's not a ton to do in this town and kids drink but you know promise we have these rules and you're on a team you have to stick by the rules ,0
yeah Chris come on you're getting peer pressure I don't know like being in a sports team you feel very you have to like be unified with the group yeah well you're one of the leaders right and as being one of the leaders but my fellow teammates expect me to be except expect them to Li not only in the sports but also in social environments and if that's socialist social custom in our society so well maybe cancer leading as a non-drinker then I could but that could also backfire on me I feel that I could be ridiculed for being having a stick up my butt you know you're a star player who's gonna pick on you ,0
it's the all right well what's of the mob yeah so the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking I can't be hearing that you're at parties and you can't be seeing pictures on facebook you know they're there are rules at this school and in my job I have to enforce them so you know like I said I get it you know I understand I know what it's like I get that you want to have fun your teenage years I get that but you know you are a star player we want to keep you on the team you know we got to figure out a way to get through this well I'll dedicate the time not to party and like no not-not-not party but you get involved with alcohol to that extent and like have it publicized on the Internet ,0
all right yeah I mean we got to have a deal here if you're gonna be on the team okay right oh stop all right you promise all right shake all right. I'll see you later  ,0
"Hi Liz will thanks for meeting with me today so what's something that you'd like to change or work towards  C; well, I’ve really been thinking about working out lately, I really want to start working out again, It’s been on my mind, and I know I need to do it. It’s just getting the motivation to do it. ",0
"and you’ve been talking about that a lot lately, So I really feel like this is something you need to do soon, because a lot of time there’s just a lot of talk, but there’s no action. And if you really want to see results, I guess it’s something that needs to be done and stop being lazy about it and just do it. ",0
"and it sounds like a lot of excuses to me, and you have shared with me before that you do have a gym membership so that’s just something you need to fit in your schedule. So for you to see results you want, my guess is that you need to go about  to  times a week and really fit in that hour workout on a daily basis. ",0
"and it seems like if you really want to see the results you have to put the time in and if it’s gonna take you two hours it’s gonna take you two hours. And again, if you want the results you need to start and you need to start now. ",0
"I;m looking forward you see you tomorrow, and I'm hoping that you are going to be able to tell me that you went to the gym.   ",0

okay finish the exam have some good news and they have some not-so-good news looks like you don't have any cavities so that's the good news,0
however I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth actually if you look up here a roof of your mouth I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use and you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user so I'm just wondering what's going on,0

okay so I think that's a pretty common misconception because they're fruit flavored people think they're okay those are really bad for you did you know that,0
right there still cigars and there's still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer oral cancer emphysema all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarettes,0
uh-huh well that's I mean at least you're not doing that so that's good but it's still causing a lot of problems and as I said I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth you're causing some serious damage and this needs to stop have you thought about quitting,0
what do you mean,0

well I appreciate you thinking about I hope you'll think about it really hard you know this is something that I'm going to continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change,0
hi you Julie Thompson ,0
hi I'm horse Berger I work in the clinic I know you're here to pick up a prescription today I noticed that we noticed some your records that you've been coming in and getting Sarah's rescue rescue inhaler for her asthma quite frequently and you haven't got her chronic inhaler for quite some time now I also know she's been in the emergency room several times this year is can you tell me what's going on there ,0
well III need to tell you that the the medicine that she's taking the chronic inhaler which is really essential to controlling her asthma does is not a steroid like you're thinking it's it's much safer it's very safe she and she needs to take it to get her asthma under control and I also want to tell you that your smoking does affect her asthma even if even if it's outside it gets on her clothes and to be honest I'd like to see you quit smoking for you anyway but if you want to keep her out of the emergency room she needs to use that chronic inhaler every day and you need to watch your smoking ,0
okay I you know I don't want to argue with you about this I I know that if you you died if you want to keep Sarah out of the emergency room I just wish you'd heed what I'm saying she needs to use that chronic inhaler every day to get her to get her asthma under control and the smoke and your clothes and smoking flares her asthma so she really needs to use that chronic inhaler and you really need to think about quitting smoking fine ,0
okay well I hope you really listen to what I'm telling you about it using that chronic hailer and i hope you consider quitting smoking ,0
good  ,0
okay so why don't you have a rinse David. how are you feeling ,0
good here take a look see what you think that feeling and the colors okay? you know there is quite a lot of stainings so I'm just wondering about um some concerns about smoking possibly gonna get that a coffee tea yeah have you heard this before yeah mm-hmm so you know the smoking is going to be related not just to some of the other negative consequences you know physically it infects dental caries dental cavities,0
um healing yeah in your mouth okay,0
yes and I really want to be helpful I really want to you know my commitment is to your oral health so there are lots of medications out there David that actually take away a lot of the cravings there they make winning song to my old things ,0
know it but David it's not a waste research hows that people take on average about seven tries before they quit smoking so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting ,0
well I don't think I'm giving you a lecture it's really not what I meant I know ,0
well there's there's a reason that other people are talking to quit no but as I said these medications so you've tried the medication you've been willing once then can I write you a prescription for the medication can we talk about how you could use it? because this is something that that's very important not just for your overall physical ha guess ,0
oh no the smoking is going to cause you more problems than the than anything else I can promise you that David the side effects from the medications are nothing compared to what can happen from the smoking like that's the I think thing to really consider ,0
I'm okay but you ,0
okay well thanks for listening and honestly I I am really worried about the smoking so okay,0
I'm here to help,0
Laura so thanks for coming in I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about so basically I'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester and we're gonna talk about you know whatever's kind of going on in your life I'll ask you some questions about you know your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of things and then we'll talk a little bit about you know different behaviors and and stuff like that and so it's it's pretty casual pretty informal just sort of a chance for me to get to know you. alright okay why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself? ,0
"okay, and what do you like to do for fun?",0
and when you and your friends are hanging out and what do you do go to?,0
okay and what kind of hobbies do you have?,0
so oh cool what are your plans for after high school?,0
that's great what do you think you'll study?,0
Oh neat ,0
that's great that's a really good goal yeah,0
it's a hard work to get into law school. How are you doing in  school? what kind of grades do you get?,0
so we're pretty good okay okay. What classes are you not getting A's and B's in?,0
oh yeah okay and do you know where you're going to apply to college? ,0
"okay cool, and and what made you decide maybe law school or journalism?",0
"okay great sounds like you have like I said really good goals and you're working hard in school you said that when you're going out with your friends you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties, so do you drink alcohol?",0
okay and how often do you think you drink?,0
mm-hmm so like once or wice a month you're having alcohol?,0
okay and so that's maybe like  times a year possibly yeah so that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then ,0
okay what do you think the most you've ever had?,0
so but you've been drunk before? ,0
okay so the most you've ever ever had is two drinks in a day. okay interesting. so do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol?,0
"yeah okay so one of the things that you know it's really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving so you know that's actually a really big problem and and even around here we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident so that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing. all right, have you ever done that have you ever done ever drunk driven? ",0
"okay, how much do your friends drink?",0
what about at these parties you're going to? there are other kids there who are drinking a lot?,0
and do you hang out with them?,0
mm-hmm so you know even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk. Did you know that?,0
that make sense. yeah so there I mean a lot of the other dangers of drinking like not just car accidents we can have other accents you know people you know will fall or you know break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and fallen down or you know as a girl it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted you know especially if you've been drinking then you know you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you did have you thought about?,0
so and then you know people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too also you know there have been a lot of kids even at this school gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook and then their parents find out or school finds out and you know we have a no tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol and really can get you into trouble and could put your whole college career in jeopardy have you thought about that? ,0
but you're still drinking,0
so I mean do you think it's the thing to do if you want to be an attorney?,0
okay hmm so I mean I guess what we need to do then is kind of talk about some goals for how to be safer ,0
um obviously you shouldn't be drinking at all um what do you think about that?,0
so do you think you can quit?,0
so okay so I'm gonna write down then that you've decided to quit and that's going to be your goal and that's great you know that's really why we're here is to talk about that and make sure that you come to that decisio um so I guess can you quit this weekend?,0
okay and then what about your friends who are still drinking?,0
okay and what if they won't?,0
yeah probably if your friends won't quit drinking you should ust find new friends because you know the problem is if they're drinking they're going to pressure you into drinking and then you're going to feel awkward and you know you're going to be stuck and and not know what to do and really just be better off probably without them if they're if they're the kind of people who are going to keep drinking they're probably not a good influence and then then you'll be better set for college too because you know the issue is you're getting good grades now but when you get to college it's a lot harder and you know if you're needing really good grades to get into law school which you will need then you really can't be distracted by alcohol,0
okay so um that's great because it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you um let's see I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking they would be pretty upset ,0
oh okay so yeah just another reason why you probably need to just quit then ,0
yeah okay so like I said I'm gonna write down here that you've decided to quit and you know I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably next semester sometime so we can kind of check in and make sure that you know that's still going well and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here no I think I'm good okay um any questions or no?,0
okay you're sure okay all right um well that's probably it then you can head back to class and and thanks for coming in   ,0
um apparently you got something on friday ,0
freaking out about what?,0
I'm sure you knew from the beginning you the options word you could go to jail we could be found not guilty but you elected to plead guilty so you knew the auction was it was very likely that you were going to go to jail ,0
you'll get an opportunity to walk in the court ,0
didn't know we explained that early on  ,0
"Discuss a little bit of your medical history in your taking your vitals. I'd like to ask you a few more questions. The rise in your blood pressure is concerning me, so I would like to gather a bit more information about your life style. ",0
Have you had any major stressful events recently or any change in your work situation?,0
I would also like to ask about some health habits that can contribute to high blood pressure. Do you smoke at all?,0
Do you drink alcohol and including beer or wine,0
I'm concerned about the amount that you're drinking currently it sounds like you're having about  to  drinks per week. It’s definitely more than what we would recommend and could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. ,0
Well according to your chart your blood pressure has gone up since July and you said that you've been drinking more recently so do you see the connection there. ,0
alcohol can have some dangerous effects on your body so long with contributing to high blood pressure can have a big impact on your liver would you need to keep in mind so your liver has several different roles in your body for acid helps process excess fatty acids before they get distributed to the rest of your body and also helps process Alcohol and Other Drugs so when you have an excess of alcohol your liver can't work as efficiently and the fatty acids build up an overtime your liver won't be able to work as well. ,0
"How about the use of other drugs like cocaine, hyrewen, marijuana? ",0
Have you ever used any prescription medications they weren't prescribed for you or in a way that wasn't prescribed?  ,0
"Ok, it sounds to me that the increase in your drinking could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. I think decreasing the number of drinks that you have when you go out and maybe decreasing the number of times that you go to the bar each week could be the best thing that you can do for your health. ",0
And then we'll set up an appointment for about a month from now will recheck your blood pressure and see how you're doing with all this.   ,0
we had a serious car crash you're lucky you didn't kill yourself or somebody else what do you intend to do about their drinking problem  C;	what what drinking problem look I had a couple of beers my friends assault ,0
your alcohol level was  clearly you had more than a few beers now how much do you really drink each day,0
look I'm an ER doc and I I think I know when somebody's an alcoholic and I think you have a serious drinking problem you better straighten it out now you can get out of here as soon as I stitch you up but in the future do not drink and drive have some sense I mean next time you might not be so lucky  ,0
Hi thanks criminy to see me today and I got a letter from the hospital saying that you had been very well and you've been in hospital so I thought I'd bring you in and have a chat about what's been happening tell me what happened ,0
what's up symptoms are you having ,0
how long qas that therefore and did they tell you what the source of the problem was ,0
yeah yeah they wrote to me in this episode of Dual Pharisees which is blood vessels in food part because of alcohol did they give you a new advice when you left hospital or any support ,0
you take them your nose up ,0
are you still drinking that moment,0
much are you drinking at the moment ,0
you seem a bit more agitated than I've seen you before do you feel worse than yourself ,0
did you feel lower than you have done with all ,0
do you feel suicidal oh I've not heard you talk ice before,0
did you injure yourself,0
I mean I'm worried about I'm not seeing you this low before ,0
when you see someone for me ,0
I just I'm just sorry I'm just having I'm just waiting  ,0
Heather hey I'm here to get my insulin refill ,0
okay my name's Laura I'm the pharmacist here let me just look you up in the computer ,0
your name?,0
and your date of birth?,0
okay a few right here it looks like you haven't had your insulin refilled in a couple of months have you been using it?,0
it it's really important that you use your insulin exactly as prescribed it's really dangerous to let your blood Sugar's run high. what have they been when you test them? ,0
is pretty high do you know what the risks are associated with letting your blood Sugar's run high like that? ,0
so they can be very serious that can even lead to things like blindness you can get a really bad infection in your foot and maybe have to lose it I don't want that to happen to you and I'm sure you don't either no it's really important that you take your infant exactly as prescribed I know it hurts but just do it for me do it for yourself  ,0
so Tommy I wanted to talk to you because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures that are kind of concerning to me of you and some of your friends at a party and you know you're such a good kid like I don't know what you're doing drinking it's gonna ruin your life,0
Tommy there's so many consequences with drinking you know you're not even 21 yet you could get arrested you could you know have a drunk driving accident you could you know mess up your schoolwork you have such a bright future ahead of you it just really really concerns me,0
there's really no such thing as not drinking too much I mean anything that's drinking when you're underage is drinking too much you know like think about it think about all the things that can happen to you,0
yeah I understand exactly what you're saying and,0
like every weekend,0
Tommy I'm just so concerned you know can't you think of anything better to do,0
are your friends the problem like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you're partying with,0
well there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice right that's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what's best for you and I just you know I really think you should think about making a big change here,0
I think you really need to quit,0
I think you're wrong you know it really worries me anyway I wish you would quit if all you're gonna do is cut down that's better than nothing you know I appreciate you talking to me about this but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it it's really important,0
yeah you're right I don't want I don't want to be too far gone before it's too late like I I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape and I I guess I've never really had any any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much or affected anybody close to me that much so I guess it's something that I feel like I'm in control of but in reality I might not have as much control as I think,0
yeah I think that that would be a good step forward into an a life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol,0
all right Chris so I need to talk to you because as you know we have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school and as as athletic director it's my job to check in with our student athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule and I've been hearing some chatter from some other kids about party this weekend and from what I hear where you were there and you know I can't confirm or deny anything so I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences but I do want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how you know you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams,0
yeah I get it like we've all been there okay you know I was in high school once - you know I drank - I get it there's not a ton to do in this town and kids drink but you know promise we have these rules and you're on a team you have to stick by the rules,0
yeah Chris come on you're getting peer pressure,0
yeah well you're one of the leaders,0
maybe Panther leading as a non-drinker then I could but that could also backfire on me I feel that I could be ridiculed for being I mean stake up my butt you know,0
I mean it's just one I'm just one person it's the,0
yeah so the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking I can't be hearing that you're at parties you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook you know there there are rules at this school and in my job I have to enforce them so you know like I said I get it you know I understand I know what it's like I get that you want to have fun you're teenagers I get that but you know you are a star player we want to keep you on the team you know we got to figure out a way to get through this,0
what do you mean,0
all right yeah I mean we got to have a deal here if you're gonna be on the team okay,0
all right you promise all right shake all right we'll see you later,0
why miss Clark my name is Alan Lyme doctor still hasn't told you about your drinking,0
he said that you filled out the form and that you came to him for some medication for your stress but they're really concerned about your alcohol consumption before I made you any made any prescriptions for you so let me see that form please,0
thanks yeah well it says here that you drink four more times a week and that you have for one or two drinks and that you go over that limit on a fairly regular basis that's too much that's too much I mean I imagine that he's already told you that he can't prescribe you anything unless you do something about his drinking,0
well I'm sure you're not because anybody that the drinks of these levels isn't going to throw talking about her drinking with a professional like myself what we know is that if you if you continue to drink at this rate you're probably going to wind up drinking more and more and imagine as he's concerned as you can order to me now,0
happy this is a glass I mean this is a typical glass which is five ounces of wine but but what I know is that most people doing a lot more of that so,0
I'm pretty sure that your glass is recent bigger than our wouldn't you say,0
I don't I've been in the house where they have these stem glasses that's only a restaurant most people have tumblers so imagine that's why I find about good your cupboards and well anyway so what he said was that you came to him for some kind of benzodiazepine something for anxiety and we can't prescribe anything like that much if you're drinking of these levels so we need you to stop or at least cut back to reasonable levels which for you would be number three drinks in one setting which you're drinking over that now or no more than seven drinks among which you are well over right now so if you can agree to that and then perhaps you can make that prescription for I can't promise that either but but that's certainly one thing the other thing you need to do is to read this take this pamphlet and read it and you'll see in there that it tells you about limits of alcohol I think you'll find that if you if you can stick to there you should be okay you may be able to prescribe the medication Empire not shortcut promise but if you do have problems and I'm suspect you may have problems coming back to those levels then we can make a referral for you to counselor to come and talk about your increased drinking so any questions for me and,0
all right well thanks and I'll talk dr. Zeile you came in and you were reasonably compliant and that you said you'd follow through,0
all right thanks,0
I can see it's after my dad you today,0
all right then okay well let's let's just have a look shall we see what's going on you just fine open your mouth for me so ah,0
okay right see if your honesty I'm looking there it just looks like one of those viruses that going around at the moment that are causing these sore throats so I think that we should just go for a bit of paracetamol and some fluids and snail it nature sort it out,0
well I mean I'm sorry we're a bit late but you know that's general practice isn't it you know sometimes these things happen but there's also the fact that you do just have a virus and they are very common and the nice thing is that it will get better with paracetamol and fluids and the process will help with giving it to the kids I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about that it's unlikely they'll get it but I'm going to it,0
all right well well not really you need to self-certifying you for seven days off six it's going to take some time off just take some paracetamol lots of fluids get a self-certified note and it in to your employer and put sauce right there,0
oh well obviously that's a non NHS thing so we have to charge you for that going rate that is 12 pounds,0
how does the paracetamol do you understand how difficult this is going to be for me I mean I could lose my job or something okay,0
okay,0
And now she's coughing. Um.,0
Sounds like post-nasal drip. I think it's probably just a virus.,0
"Um, and I don't think she needs antibiotics, it's not going to do anything.",0
"But uh, and she'll probably be better by the weekend.",0
"Um, before we finish up today I think we really need to talk about Ganesa weight.",0
"Um, according to the chart she is has a BMI of  which is at the  percentile, which is considerably overweight and we need to think about getting her weight down. Um, does she eat healthy does she, is she pretty active?",0
"Well, I think we need to check her cholesterol and her triglycerides. Cus, um, at this BMI, they, um, there might be some problems already, some serious problems, and if we look at these labs now, you know maybe you'll start to see that this is a serious problem.",0
"Well, I guess the blood work can wait, but we're going to have to get it done within the next year. Let's talk about her exercise, does she get enough aerobic exercise?",0
"Okay, okay, well what about her diet. Does she eat a lot of junk food or drink soda?",0
"Okay, well, um, you're going to have to cut the fast food down to no more than once a week. And lemonade, it's as bad as soda, it's full of sugar, so you're going to have to get her to drink more water.",0
"Oh, Okay, well, do what you can. And tell me about her T.V. Does she watch a lot of T.V.?",0
"Okay, well, the American Academy Pediatrics recommends no more than two hours a day, so I think we're going to have to get that down to below two hours.",0
"Okay,",0
"well, listen um, we're going to need to finish up here. I'd really like to see Ganesa lose three to five pounds before we see her again. So, let me just kinda go over what we talked about. More water, less junk food, less fast food and uh, cut down on the TV. Does that sound okay?",0
"Okay, Thanks for coming in.",0
How are you?,0
"Well, I don't know last time I called you and then the phone is not ringing and I'm not sure.  I'm glad you called.",0
And set up an appointment with me.,0
Wow.,0
Really?,0
"Well, before we begin I just want to remind you that all calls at Aetna is subject to be monitored and recorded for the quality assurance, okay.",0
"And then also about genetic information non discrimination act just a reminder too that because of legislation prohibits gathering genetic information so when you answer my question you don't have to include any family medical history or any information related to genetics, okay?",0
So how you been since I spoke to you last time?,0
"Okay, when was that?",0
"Okay, what the doctor say?",0
"Usually, yeah, if you don't hear from the doctor that means good news isn't it?",0
Because if something's wrong most definitely they will call you.,0
So you do all the cholesterol check and everything?,0
I mean the doctor draws your blood work.,0
"Well, I just want to ask you a question this time.  I want to ask you about the tobacco that you've been using, so what kind of tobacco product you use?",0
"Okay, like a chewing tobacco?",0
So you used the last four weeks?,0
You have been using the last four weeks?,0
"Sixty years, have you been to the dentist to have them check your mouth?",0
Do you see a dentist?,0
So you have not seen a dentist for how many years?,0
"You're kidding me, really,  to  years ago, oh my gosh.  You're probably the only person I know that don't see the dentist.",0
"Well, usually dentists will check your mouth.  Sometimes if you chew tobacco you have a chance that there might have some growth or something abnormal in your mouth and you don't know, you see.",0
So you kind of take care of your mouth?,0
But you only use the leaf tobacco; you're not smoking or anything.,0
"But, how often do you chew tobacco a day?",0
All day long?,0
So how much does that cost you?,0
"So basically, you're not planning on cutting down; you are just going to do the same thing?",0
Okay.,0
Have you ever used any type of medication or any nicotine to try to stop chewing tobacco?,0
"No, okay.",0
And your doctor knows about it that you chew tobacco?,0
And you have not been checked with ultrasound or anything like that?  Have you ever had an abdominal aortic aneurysm test?  Probably not.,0
"If you not see a dentist, I bet you.",0
Did your wife use any tobacco products?,0
"She use to smoke, okay.",0
"Well, you know, a lot of time just like, what's his name Georg Burns, I think he smoke or something all his life right, and, but even though she smoked you didn't want to smoke you just only want to chew?",0
"Oh, you did.",0
"For  years, okay.",0
years.,0
"Well, your wife make you, how did she make you?",0
"Well, it is my job that I have to inform you about the risk of smoking or not smoking but chew tobacco the risk is to get a sore or ulcer in your mouth you may not know because sometimes it might start in some area that you cannot feel, okay.  So, but when in doubt you do see the doctor you can always go to that doctor that check your lab and have them see just to be sure whenever something happen, okay.",0
"Yeah, and just to make sure that because you know why if early early detection is much better then when you do them late.",0
"Because when I use to work at cancer hospital and I know that have a cancer in the mouth it just not a pleasant thing.  It affects a lot of eating and things like that, you know, and if probably you have cancer in the lungs, right, you can eat, but cancer in the mouth, it's just very difficult.",0
"I just want to let you know that at least check your mouth, if you don't want doctor check you can check it and then you can examine yourself, you know, do your, do your gargle and things like that to kind of keep, you know, keep, because I'm a nurse and I've seen it and I just think like oh, my gosh, you know, if you have something wrong in the mouth, it's probably the most devastating because we have to eat food and when you cannot food it makes it so difficult.",0
You have a problem with weight gain?,0
"Yeah, and you play golf.",0
"Well, and another thing, you know, you can think about because right now you use them all the time, you know, sometime even though you quit just a little bit or something like that it could help too.  So think about that okay and then I sure appreciate you calling I always enjoy talking to you.  You always have something to tell me like, you know, how, a lot of times people don't think about taking something to kind of help with your acid and stuff like that, you have a lot of knowledge in some way, the old fashion way.",0
"From your family, did your family smoke?",0
They work hard.,0
"Yeah, in a lot of old days that's how people do it.",0
"You know, you not depend on with a lot of medication like what we do now.",0
"A lot of old remedies back then, you know, that people do and people use.",0
Your garlic and all that stuff.,0
And you take niacin.,0
"Yeah, and I think, you know, just have to kind of make some sense about this okay and then I will call you next time.  I'd like to ask you a question about your diabetes.",0
"Okay.  I have spoke to many people that they don't check too, it doesn't surprise me now when you say that.  But anyway, let me go ahead; look to see what day I can call you okay?",0
"Let me take a look to see what we have.  Well, the number I dial now what is this number?",0
"Okay, the cell let me look to see if I have ... .  Let me take a look at my record.",0
Yes.,0
"Okay, the number I have is.",0
"Okay, all right, I will do that.  Call the house that way I won't miss you.",0
That's true and that's true.  Let me make an appointment to call you back on July .,0
It's Friday.,0
How late?,0
Like today?,0
"Well on the th I can't call you at, how about, let me take a look some other day.",0
"How about on the th, Monday?",0
On the th yes.,0
I can call you anytime you want me to.,0
So th would be good on Monday?,0
How about like  your time?,0
okay?,0
Yes.,0
"Well, I will send a reminder call two days before our appointment, okay.  But since being on the weekend, th, let me see, you'll probably get the reminder call probably maybe on the th.",0
"Okay, on the th and then you do have my number.",0
"And I sure appreciate your time calling me so that way I get to talk to you and then, you know, I always enjoy talking to you.",0
You did great.  I mean you did great.  It's not hard.,0
"Well, you do talk to me all the time, what you talking about.  I've been talking to you for so many months now.  Just like you read it, if you just read like, you know, kind of break it down into the three syllables.",0
"Well, don't call me by a different name, I might not answer you.  I might not know my name, you know.  That's not my name.",0
What is your wife's name?  That's a beautiful name.,0
See I can call her she can call my name.,0
So how many children do you have?,0
"Wow, seven.",0
"Well, they add up quick, you know.",0
"And then, and then, you've got a hard time keep track of them.  What's their name and all that.",0
Grandchildren.,0
Oh wow.  You're doing good.  You remember.,0
"Well, you know, you're doing good but don't forget what we talked about today, okay, about your chew tobacco and your mouth and the next month I'm going to talk about your blood sugar, okay.",0
All right.  Thank you very much and say hello to your wife for me.,0
And I'll talk to you next month and I'll send you the reminder call okay?,0
"Thank you so much for calling me back, I sure appreciate it and you have a wonderful ... .",0
And you have a wonderful month.,0
"I sure will, thank you, bye-bye, goodnight.",0
"Good afternoon, this is April from the pharmacy, could I speak to Faith please?",0
I see you haven't picked up your prescription this month. Are you having some problems with it?,0
Yeah.,0
Who' your doctor?,0
Have you had any symptoms lately?,0
Do you have any problems taking the drug?,0
Are you having problems paying for it because we can help you with that.,0
I'm not sure I understand what the problem is.,0
"As it says in the patient education kit you received, it reduces the risk of a second attack by over forty percent. The clinical data is very strong.",0
"Well, Avonex provides a thirty seven percent reduction in risk of progression to sustain disability in two years and a forty-four reduction in risk of developing a second relapse in up-to three years.",0
Are you interested in reordering your prescription?,0
It's important that you stay on it. There aren't really many options for MS.,0
My expert opinion is that you stay on the medication until it does. Until newer drugs are developed this is the bet e have.,0
"Well, only if you think about it that way.",0
Unless there's anything else I can do to help.,0
"Okay, bye bye. ",0
just fine so um we'll keep an eye on the stomach problems that you described today and as soon as your lab tests come back will our office will be in touch with you ,0
I did notice that you filled out our alcohol questionnaire so we'll need to go over that before you leave let me just verify some information real quick what is it that you typically drink?,0
so a standard  ounces as standard can or bottle that's what you're drinking how many days a week are you drinking?,0
about three days a week and how many beers on the days that you drink? C	usually four or five maybe a six pack T	okay so up to six drinks on the days that you're drinking about three days a week ,0
so based on that information that you've told me and then looking over your questionnaire here have to tell you for a man your age you're in a high-risk category really for Falls accidents other health problems that sort of thing developing in relation to your drinking what do you think about that?,0
well in my professional opinion you're really not too far behind your friends if you say that they're having some problems you've come in today complaining about the stomach problems and unless you're willing to quit or at least cut back those problems are bound to just get worse so what are your thoughts about that?,0
mr. Wilson I could just give you a prescription and send you on your way but again unless you're willing to change your alcohol drinking so quitting would be optimum but at least cutting back the chances or you'll end up back here and we'll just be having the same conversation again ,0
hello Neil hi hi ding ,0
still there ,0
you've not be able to deal with it or make any significant change ,0
mm-hmm,0
now you you've been making efforts in to try and forcing yourself to do the work you set out the things needed to be done the computer the software and the box but then like you wait for something to happen ,0
you'll be fairly University,0
so you kind of want to be here because it's not going home where you don't want to return to and staying here has consequences in that you're required to work required to do specific tasks specific job specific projects I get that something gets in the way of you working ,0
so it's not just not being able to do the work there's also something of not going in two lectures to university maybe not getting any more work ,0
there's a consequence of getting not getting the work done okay where I'm afraid that we're out of time for now so we need to stop  ,0
well I'm here for my cleaning what I'm also having a lot of trouble flossing because of my braces I can't get the laws under my wire and I've just found that it's just been way too hard so I just stopped doing it ,0
okay well let me ask you a question and you can just explain it to the best of your ability but what do you think clogging is? how do you think it affects your teeth? ,0
okay yes not only is the redness and the inflammation a problem but if you continue to let it get worse and worse you can actually deteriorate your bone routine now that you know more about black do you think stop flossing?,0
there's a lot of things in life that are hard but we all have to do them so I can give you some flossing it's that i recommend everything so basically just going to your lot more Walgreens or any and ask the person in the store to point you towards the right direction and basically you're looking for a class in hey and what you're going to do is we're going to take the floss and you're going to straight end and go in between your and then Glaus each individual tooth like that ,0
well you need to do it and you need at least try to do it because you don't your teeth when you could have just prevented it by doing it for a few much today ,0
so I really want to see some improvement at our next appointment with the flossing technique that I have recommended for you and we'll see how you do next time ,0
"Mm, except there's nothing funny about mental illness.",0
So depression huh? The big D.,0
"You know, I find it so surprising that people can be depressed nowadays when there's new Star Wars movies coming out, like this guy.",0
Well that's your opinion.,0
Please describe your symptoms.,0
"Okay, uh, on a scale of  to , how dark?",0
"being the lowest,  being the highest.",0
"Wow, nice.",0
How do those thoughts make you feel?,0
"Alright, this sounds like you're quoting the Smiths. Are you quoting the Smiths?",0

Okay. Please continue describing your symptoms.,0
"Alright there Marcy, I'm your therapist, not your Tumblr.",0
"It's the oldest trick in the book. A super handsome guy walks into a therapist's office, tricks her with his rustic charms.",0
"Yeah, yeah I am. And my suspicions were confirmed the moment you started quoting the Smiths.",0
"Well, oh my gosh, now I know you're lying. Who doesn't listen to the Smiths? Are you sure you like Star Wars?",0
Did you come here for a prescription for anti-depressants?,0
"Well people like you disgust me. You know, handsome guys lurking around clubs, selling pills to drunken -somethings who don't know any better.",0
People looking for happy times. Haven't you heard the grin and tonic?,0
"Yeah, it's exactly what it sounds like.",0
"Okay, um, so, um, off-topic, would you ever want to get together sometime? We can drink red wine, listen to the Smiths...",0
Okay. Okay. Mmm... [the Smiths plays] So handsome... mmm. ,0
it's a good morning my name is Jane ,0
okay so i'll be your additional therapist today and the doctor recently told you the UH pre-diabetes and I wanted to get your reaction to this news so that I can better help ,0
so you were pretty shocked and I'm sensing you might be quite scared too ,0
you feel like having diabetes will cause some unfortunate lifestyle changes what I'm hearing says you don't want your bad health to affect the way to affect your career ,0
so you feel like you're just not giving the attention your body really deserves ,0
can you tell me a little bit more about what you do? ,0
okay so you recognize the importance of exercise,0
so yeah I think that you should make exercise a part of your life um exercise is huge and managing your diabetes if you're overweight it can help you lose weight exercise can also help with your blood sugar and it can also reduce your stress levels ,0
I think yeah I think exercise is the right step for you to stop the progression of your diabetes um so how many days a week do you think you can exercise? ,0
can you make it a goal to exercise three to four times a week? I need you to do it more than just one day ,0
I really think that making exercise important part of your wife is crucial for you ,0
I'll tell you what you should do I'll give you the name of my trainer just come in mention my name and he'll take care of you um his name is George this is this hot italian guy um he really makes working out a walk in the park so you'll go see him ,0
this will be great for you I'm being physically active is an essential part in the treatment of diabetes it will lower your blood sugar um body fat your body fat will decrease and you'll really feel so much better ,0
well thanks for coming in today um I feel very confident about this exercise thing that will be successful next time you come in we'll look at the progress you made and it kind of increased the number of times that you're exercising a day ,0
okay bye thank you   ,0
the good news is he doesn't have pneumonia it's just an upper respiratory tract infection a cold so there's some things you can do to make to help him get better you can avoid excessive dust you can keep them hydrated avoid over-the-counter cold remedies keep them away from people who have flu or cold like symptoms and avoid smoke and the last one should be easy because you quit smoking during your pregnancy ,0
no wait a minute that has everything to do with what we're talking about I can't believe at the end of this appointment you're just slipping in the fact that you've resumed smoking again that's very very important information for me to know and I'd like to spend some time talking about it now  ,0
come on Haley you're here because you thought he had pneumonia you're telling me that Jake can't breathe your concern about is breathing and then you just slip in the fact that you're smoking cigarettes and you think there's no relationship? do I really need to review all the risks of smoking in front of your child or exposing him to secondhand smoke not to mention the risk that you're posing to yourself and your own health  ,0
so it sounds like if you have alcohol then smoking is very difficult to avoid and you know what you need to do you need to go home and as your your son's doctor I need to tell you you need to go home and throw cigarettes you need to quit  ,0
and let's talk some more about wine you keep throwing wine into the conversation it sounds like it's become a significant part of your daily routine how much are you drinking? ,0
well no one says motherhood was going to be easy Harry so let's talk about these drinks are we talking about the low risk drinking guidelines one to two standard drinks a night? are we talking about a muggle margaritas? ,0
what are you drinking? what's the quantity that you're drinking?  ,0
there's other ways to reiax there's yoga there's deep breathing you need to stop raising the roof and raise your kid this is not okay you're not just worrying about hailey anymore it's Hailey and Jake you're a mom now  ,0
I'm trying not to be hard on you hailey but I've got to tell you as a physician it's a very big deal your drinking and your tobacco use are red flakes for me and they need to stop immediately so we've already talked about your plan for smoking you're going home you're throwing out your cigarette you're putting on the patches what's the plan for the alcohol? ,0
sounds good and if you need to relax go for a walk join a moms group read a book how about you come back in a week when we have Jake six-month checkup and you can let me know how that quit plans going? ,0
Thanks  ,0
come in hello  ,0
yes yes yeah it's not that long since you were last here ,0
you're not happy ,0
I think you're overreacting I think I think that ,0
can I tell you what your options are here? ,0
first of all tell me what was the problem is taking the medicine? what was the problem no that you couldn't take the medicine as prescribed? C	well it's it I mean I'm busy I'm traveling or visiting I always said if T	this isn't reality C	 with me you need to make a pro I've already made my mind of it I'm not wanting to go down the tablet route it's the history ,0
okay a hysterectomy assaulting the last time you were here we discussed and having a coil that can be quite effective in helping with favourably ,0
well that's a non-medical alternative,0
um see from your records here that you're  yes I'm afraid that I'm not prepared to consider even putting your name forward of that,0
you might want and regrets I don't want to learn I want amid that life choice I'm quite happy it might be your decision if you want children but as a doctor I'm not prepared to make that decision and to verify that decision for you ,0
I have been listening to you for a period of six weeks and I I'm feeling ,0
sorry earlier I think fix I think I'm going to have to it's to ivett it sorry Susan riese if what you're asking ,0
I think that would be for the best because I can't help you any further I'll cube-like you come to that agreement thank you very much thank you  ,0
"Great, how are you doing today?",0
Doing great.,0
"Alright, your blood pressure is  over ",0
Yes.,0
"Well, not always. It looks like you got a letter about your AC and you haven't been taking very good care of your diabetes.",0
Your AC. It measures the amount of sugar that's been on your hemoglobin in the last three months do determine how well you've been controlling your blood sugar.,0
"Well let's see. today it was . and three months ago, it was .. So normal is less than , you're way out of control.",0
Well your health is something you have to make time for. Have you at least been taking your diabetic medications?,0
"Well it looks like that's not really adequate, so you need to be taking your medications. Diet and exercise sometimes just aren't enough. Your chart says that you've been prescribed Metformin which is a long lasting medicine that will keep your blood sugar under control all day. I think it will be more effective than just diet and exercise. Are you testing your blood sugar?",0
"Ok, how often?",0
"Well remember, your AC was high like I said earlier and that's a much better indicator than how you feel. So um, it showed that you were out of control. If you don't start making changes, you can permanently damage your eyesight, blood vessels, even have to have a front leg amputated",0
I don't think you realize how serious your disease is.,0
*Sigh* Just because you feel fine doesn't mean that you're healthy. Having diabetes affects you more than you realize and some people feel fine when they have a big ulcer on their foot.,0
"Well, those are some symptoms of high blood sugar but you can have the high blood sugar without those symptoms. That's the whole reason for doing an AC, to determine if your blood sugar is out of control, and your AC showed that your blood sugar has been out of control.",0
"Heart medications and diabetic medications are very different. You can't generalize the experience your grandfather had to this medication, they're completely different. Will you at least try taking your medications?",0
"Alright, well we'll see you in a few months then. ",0
Hi miss Clark my name is Alan Lyme. Doctor still ask me to talk about your drinking ,0
he said that you filled out the form and that you came to him for some medication for your stress but they're really concerned about your alcohol consumption. Before I made you any made any prescriptions for you so let me see that form please..okay thanks..yeah well it says here that you drink four more times a week and that you have for one or two drinks and that you go over that limit on a fairly regular basis that's too much that's too much I mean I imagine that he's already told you that he can't prescribe you anything unless you do something about his drinking ,0
I'm sure you're not because anybody that the drinks of these levels isn't going to throw talking about her drinking with a professional like myself what we know is that if you if you continue to drink at this rate you're probably going to wind up drinking more and more and imagine as he's concerned as you can order to me now..,0
this is a glass I mean this is a typical glass which is five ounces of wine but but what I know is that most people doing a lot more of that so what I'm pretty sure that your glass is recent bigger than that. What would you say?,0
I don't I've been in the house where they have these stem glasses that's only a restaurant most people have tumblers so imagine that's why I find about good your cupboards and well anyway so what he said was that you came to him for some kind of benzodiazepine something for anxiety and we can't prescribe anything like that much if you're drinking of these levels so we need you to stop or at least cut back to reasonable levels which for you would be number three drinks in one setting which you're drinking over that now or no more than seven drinks among which you are well over right now so if you can agree to that and then perhaps you can make that prescription for I can't promise that either but but that's certainly one thing the other thing you need to do is to read this take this pamphlet and read it and you'll see in there that it tells you about limits of alcohol I think you'll find that if you if you can stick to there you should be okay you may be able to prescribe the medication at that point. I can't promise but if you do have problems and I'm suspect you may have problems coming back to those levels then we can make a referral for you to counselor to come and talk about your increased drinking. So any questions for me? ,0
well thanks and I'll talk dr. Zeile you came in and you were reasonably compliant and that you said you'd follow through ,0
all right thanks  ,0
okay it's a good morning my name is Jane,0
okay so I'll be regional therapist today and the doctor recently told you the UH pre-diabetes and I wanted to get your reaction to this news so that I can better help you,0
yeah so you were pretty shocked and I'm sensing it might be quite scared too,0
you feel like having diabetes will cause some unfortunate lifestyle changes what I'm hear you say is you don't want your bad health to affect the way to affect your career,0
mm-hmm yeah and I obviously haven't been this way like when I took this job I guess that's when my health started spiraling downwards and I don't know I guess that's when I kind of noticed things were kind of off as far as my health goes so,0
so you recognize the importance of exercise yeah I do but when I get that free time I just want to veg out you know you don't really want to have to come back and go to the gym you know so that's part of it too,0
um well I guess I mean it could be a way for me to avoid getting diabetes and yes taking medication,0
um I mean right now I just want to say one because you know when I travel I'm not really sure if there's ever going to be anything available and um I don't know I'd like I don't even like exercise so it would be a big step a big change for me,0
um I mean that might just be a little too much for me honestly I mean maybe when I'm stuck in a hotel and they have a gym I'm just unsure as whether I can commit to doing that much because I mean I don't want to buy a gym membership here because I'm not at home enough to use it and I feel like it would just be a waste of money,0
yeah I mean I just I don't know it's it's just difficult for me you know like I said I don't enjoy its begin with so it would be a really big step,0
I mean maybe that I still don't know,0
yeah I mean like I said we'll see,0
I'll see you next time,0
bye thank you,0
so good morning my name is Jane yeah I'll be your nutritional therapist today so the doctor had told you recently that you have pre-diabetes and I wanted to get your reaction to this news just so that I can better help you,0
so see you were pretty shocked with this news and I'm sensing you might be quite scared too,0
yeah so you feel like travel at first the affects your health but you recognize the importance of exercise and diet,0
but your lack of exercise is a concern to you it sounds like yeah a little bit I mean it does bother me like when I was younger I was much thinner and I exercise all the time not do all these sports and everything so I mean it definitely does concern me a little bit you know that I've gotten so far from that you know,0
yeah like I said I have to eat out often just because I travel a lot and also I am always on the go so I'd like driving somewhere like Panera I love Nara and I usually get like breakfast or lunch there sometimes both I think one of my favorite things is the super little bread bowl and I end up usually eating a majority of the bread ball which I know it's probably not the healthiest thing in the world and of course they give you those other options like the apples in the salad but I mean I like to stick with stuff that I like and I don't know like any of that and I mean I also don't eat too many sweets you know I mean so I think I'm okay you know sometimes I eat fine but when I travel I do like to try all the local restaurants and everything sometimes that is a bakery or - my absolute favorite thing in the world peanut butter and jelly donut I mean if you haven't tried them I'll bring one in for you to try because they're absolutely heaven and my dr. pepper honestly you can't live without my dr. pepper,0
what keeps me going so okay,0
yeah,0
yeah,0
yeah,0
so soda is that energy boost to help you through the day,0
okay so we could go in a number of directions here and I wonder which makes the most sense to you um you mentioned exercise possibly getting some healthier options when you go out and you also mention your soda consumption you may also have other things that we haven't mentioned today that you would like to discuss further so which would you like to discuss,0
so it sounds like your soda intake uh something that you know is that a control and you must not feel that energized if you have to keep drinking it throughout the day,0
so your soda consumptions a habit you'd like to break,0
so would you like to hear some ways that my other patients kind of get an energy boost that are not soda,0
so my other diabetic patients that like caffeine and a little sweet they will either have one cup of coffee in the morning or they'll drink unsweetened tea and if you like something we don't really condone artificial sweeteners but you could add a packet of stevia Splenda to your tea that's not a problem so how does that sound,0
so you sound ready to make a change you sound ready to go um do you perceive any obstacles or challenges that you might foresee with changing your soda intake,0
so that's definitely a legitimate worry I think the smart thing to do is to gradually wean you off sooner um I think you might be feeling a little lethargic and fatigued just because you're dehydrated so maybe swapping out some of the soda for water tea somedays will definitely help you out,0
great and next time we can even talk about your diet because I know fruit and vegetable intake can also give you a natural energy boost so,0
okay so those ideas sound really great in our sessions coming to a close I just wanted to thank you for being so open today and next time you come in we can talk about your diet and your soda consumption if you ever have any questions we're right here just give us a call but again thanks for coming in,0
hi I'm the pharmacist how can I help you,0
have you been here before,0
okay um so so this is a new prescription,0
no problem I'm just gonna ask you a few other questions before I fill this prescription,0
do you have any allergies,0
any medical conditions,0
and any other medications you're taking,0
okay well let me just counsel you on this medication,0
hey Monica,0
have you been since last time,0
no yeah it's kind of weird right,0
yeah that's bad we should fix that um okay take this paper and I think what'll be helpful because I think you should engage your fears so let's I'm gonna have you draw a picture of yourself going to the mall with your friends,0
yes dry yourself with your friends going to the mall but you know I thought we need a lot of markers but I changed my mind don't use these to justice,0
no I think it's best if we just use these these markers here day good right so that's you so now draw your friends with you,0
no not this one yeah téa's these what's that for,0
it looks like it's gonna protect you,0
Yeah.,0
"Well you sound a bit surprised by that but I'm sure that you've seen some of the material that that the clinic gave you about asthma symptoms and managing your asthma and pets are a really big source of problems, in that respect.",0
Mm-hmm.,0
"Well, w-, wait a second, Sal.  What do you mean yo-, yo-, ha-, if you, as an, you know, to be informed about I'm just re-, really taken aback by that because I understand from your chart that you have a young baby?",0
A new baby?,0
"And you are very concerned about your health.  You want to be there for your baby and that you've already taken some steps you've, you've almost quit smoking...",0
"...which is fantastic. So the next step is to really d-, deal with the dog, deal with the pet.  I know it's, it's going to be hard to do that but there are always people who will adopt animals.  I'm sure that you have friends or family members.",0
"It's you that I'm worried about, Sal.",0
"It's you that I'm worried about.  OK.  Th-, the symptoms are worse.  You've had two or three major asthma attacks and I, do you appreciate how this is a-, a-, a risk to your life that there are some some adults with severe asthma who actually can die as a result of their symptoms.  It, it truly is something to take very very seriously.  I can't emphasize that enough.",0
"Sal, wh-, ah, do, you understand that what happened six years ago or ten years ago, your asthma is progressively getting worse.  You know very well that the puffers, the strength of the medication is getting higher and higher and there's only so much that can be done with medication alone.  You know this.",0
"Sal, you're almost on the strongest one.  And if Oscar's that important to you then do you put Oscar higher than your baby?  Than your wife?  Like, ah, that makes no sense to me.  Do you understand how important this is?",0
[Sighs],0
OK. ,0
I know so you've got a surgery coming up soon and I see from your form that you're a smoker okay so you need to know that smoking before surgery can cause serious complications and it can delay wound healing so you're really going to need to quit now are you hearing? you know you have to quit now if you don't you're putting yourself a considerable risk of a poor surgical outcome ,0
I get that Noah but you're having surgery for cancer you got to do what's best for your health and you got to tell your family not to smoke around you then it might not be so hard to quit okay assume that means you agree? so I'm going to range for some nicotine replacement for you and I'd really like to see a quit within four weeks it's really the only option you've got to take responsibility for your own health okay we'll chat more next time I see you  ,0
hello kaleigh it looks like you're here to pick up a prescription today ,0
it looks like cholesterol Staten do you know how you're supposed to take the medication?,0
well you just take it once a day did he tell you what side effects to expect?,0
common ones are nausea vomiting headache there's some severe ones like dermatomyositis liver failure lupus rhabdomyolysis hemorrhagic cerebral infarction if you have any of those just call your doctor,0
it's for your disk lipid e mia oh yeah just one tablet a day do you have any questions for me?,0
all right great have a good day ,0
hello kaleigh I'm Lori the pharmacist here at bulldog pharmacy I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol Staten  called in by dr. Ferris today I wondered if you had a minute to talk to me? I just want to make sure that you know how best to take it and if you have any questions? ,0
okay what did the doctor tell you cholesterol sadness for?,0
he's right this medicine is designed to help lower your cholesterol and that means that it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke how did your doctor tell you to take this medicine?,0
okay well you're going to take one tablet of cholesteryl sent in twenty one time a day by mouth and you can take that with or without food when do you normally take your medications? ,0
okay that's perfect because cholesterol stenton works best if it's taken at night though you can take it anytime of the day and you should take it every single day it's important to keep that up where do you store your medications?,0
okay well then that sounds like a perfect location for you medicines keep best if they're stored away from light and heat and moisture what did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?,0
all right well this medication is pretty well tolerated which means it doesn't have very many side effects but you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains if they seem really severe to you then you should call dr. Ferris and talk to him about that also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications and even over-the-counter things so check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new and lastly grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol Stan  so if you use grapefruit juice every day I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication just so I know we're on the same page can you repeat back to me how you'll take this medicine?,0
great Kaylee I know we went over a lot today what other questions do you have for me ,0
all right well here's your prescription I even put it on auto fill for you so that it will be filled for you every at the same time every month and if you have any other questions later our phone numbers right here on the bottle and you can call me at any time thanks so much have a great day    ,0
Good. Here take a look. See what you think. Isn't that feeling,0
And the colors okay?,0
You know there is quite alot of staining. So umm I'm just wondering about umm some concerns about smoking possibly,0
"coffee, tea yeah, and you've heard this before I'm sure.",0
"So you know the smoking is going be related to not just to some of the other negative consequences you know physically it it effects dental carries, dental cavities",0
Umm healing .,0
in your mouth. Soo,0
"Yes and I really want to be helpful. I really want you to know my commitment is to your oral health so umm there are lots of medications out there, David that actually take away alot of the cravings there they make things soo much easier.",0
mmm,0
No it but David. David it's not a waste. Research shows that people take on average about  tries before they quit smoking so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting.,0
Ah well I don't think I'm giving you a lecture.,0
That's certainly not what I meant.I,0
Well there there's a reason that.,0
people are concerned. No but as I said these medications So you've tried the medication you've been willing once,0
Then can I write you a prescription for the medication and can we talk about how you could use it because this is something that that it's very important. Not just for your overall physical health,0
"Oh no, the smoking will cause you more problems than the than anything else. I can promise you that.David, the side effects from the medications are nothing compared to what can happen from the smoking.",0
Like that's the thing to really consider.,0
"Okay. Well thanks for listening and honestly I, I am really worried about the smoking so",0
I uh,0
I'm here to help. Okay?,0
Hi Mrs. Smith your exam is normal except for that lack of energy that you complained about will be joined some tests to look at your thyroid and I'll call you with the results about that,0
I noticed that you filled out one of our drug questionnaires may I take a look at it? okay so just to verify what you said on here it looks like you do not drink alcohol and you do use drugs other than those required for medical reasons just marijuana ,0
marijuana and other drugs new street drugs?,0
what about medications for pain other than what or prescribed?,0
okay how often you use marijuana?,0
five times a week yeah okay you know I wanted to show you on this chart here that using marijuana thought times a week the way you are and from what you said on our questionnaire put you in this category of being at risk ,0
yeah that needs to chew at risk for some health issues just like smoking cigarettes marijuana smoking can be harmful to your lungs and other parts of your body and I'd really recommend that you stop using marijuana okay you know that lack of energy that you talked about it could be that it's related to your use of marijuana and you are aware that marijuana is illegal ,0
and you mentioned on your form that you feel guilty sometimes and I'm wondering if perhaps giving up that marijuana maybe that feeling of guilt would go away I know you you have a daughter ,0
that's illegal perhaps would make that guilt feeling go away ,0
so where you said you'd like to start Sal is talking about your asthma and specifically about your dog and how oneis affecting the other ,0
hmm so what can you let me know or or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse?,0
right ,0
okay and that your pet has never been mentioned as a concern? ,0
yeah and I I can see that you've already worked hard to make some changes you've almost quit smoking you're just down to your last couple of cigarettes and you're not even smoking those in the house and your house is totally smoke-free ,0
okay and you have also thought about cutting back on alcohol and and I think you mentioned done done a little bit towards that ,0
okay so now almost like that's not good enough like now you have to douse the dog and I mean and now what ,0
okay so I mean there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar you know when he's in the house or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him what happens with your asthma symptoms?,0
hmm so it doesn't make total sense to you that that it's all Oscars fault and then that's the only solution,0
I guess I also wonder whether regardless of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been such a big part of your life for so long mm-hmm mmm ,0
mmm yeah and and in the end you  know whatever you whatever you do about  Oscar about your asthma about all the  other things that we talked about on  that agenda setting worksheet I mean you  are in the driver's seat Sal  it really  is your choice ,0
there's a lot of decisions and a lot of change  with your wife with the new baby and and  now thinking about looking after your  health and wanting to be healthy for  your wife and your baby you know ,0
mm-hmm so what what would need to happen or how  would you know when you win or if you  ever did have to make a decision about  whether to keep Oscar with you or not?,0
oh yeah and it got the feeling that it's something that you  want to think about that this is a really big decision and it's not one  that you're gonna make in a hurry no no,0
exam looked just fine so the only thing I'm still kind of worried about is the stomach problems and we'll keep our eye on those the labs that we drew today will get those results back to you as soon as they're available all right good now before you Dooley today i noticed that you did fill out our alcohol questionnaire is that okay with you if I look over that?,0
thank you so just briefly looking over this let me first verify what you're drinking? and how often? that sort of thing so we're on the same page what is it that you typically drink?,0
so I have a picture here this shows what a standard  ounce beer looks like is that what she'd say you're drinking typically? okay so  ounce beers how many days a week are you drinking?,0
okay about three days a week and on each of those days how many beers are you drinking in a typical day?,0
so up to a six pack three days a week all right so based on that information that you've given me and then also looking at your questionnaire here I have some information that i can give you as just a way of giving you some feedback about your drinking is that okay sure with you okay well your score on this was  so if you look right here on my card a score of  places you in the high-risk room category yes sir so this means you are at higher risk for problems developing as a result of your drinking that could be accidents or Falls or even health problems like damage to your digestive system that sort of thing what do you think about that?,0
so for you this information is not only knew but it's really surprising yeah too and it could be that drinking at the level that you're drinking could be directly related to the stomach problems that you're talking about today what do you make about that information?,0
I hear that I can understand that and like you said for you drinking with your friends is enjoyable and on the weekends at home helps you relax I'm curious what on the other hand would be some of the not so good things about drinking alcohol for you?,0
so you see really no need to change your drinking? C	no not really ,0
okay well for a man your age in this high risk category it is recommended that you actually cut out drinking altogether to reduce that risk what do you think about that?,0
well it would definitely be my recommendation if you could even cut back you know half of what you're drinking then you'd cut that risk in half and again it's recommended that you quit all together and I would definitely suggest you work on that ,0
thanks for listening thanks for discussing this with me ,0
hi dr. Martin I heard you had a question for me what did you want to talk about?,0
yeah I'm the pharmacist on duty citalopram okay it's an antidepressant and it comes in   and  milligram strength it's excreted in the urine and it has a half-life of about  hours for side effects there are sexual side effects heart side effects and stomachs side effects ,0
oh um yeah I think that should be fine ,0
alright thanks call me anytime    ,0
yeah,0
so like where did he touch you running on a schedule here,0
awful,0
I'm sorry I was drawing you with Fishlegs,0
hey they're just little loli pussy calm down all right it's chill,0
the kind of therapist I go to college for an extra year to get duh,0
the pH makes the noise that's why I have the stem,0
it's his face was fresh like what I'm sorry I run you fish,0
hey Monica,0
have you been since last time,0
no yeah it's kind of weird right,0
yeah that's bad we should fix that um okay take this paper and I think what'll be helpful because I think you should engage your fears so let's I'm gonna have you draw a picture of yourself going to the mall with your friends,0
yes dry yourself with your friends going to the mall but you know I thought we need a lot of markers but I changed my mind don't use these to justice,0
no I think it's best if we just use these these markers here day good right so that's you so now draw your friends with you,0
no not this one yeah téa's these what's that for,0
it looks like it's gonna protect you,0
I don't know how much you've been told about why you're here but basically it's my job just to meet with all the students I usually meet with you once or twice a semester and gonna be talking to kind of about your life and your goals and some behaviors that you might engage in and just the sorts of things like that. Okay so why don't you start by telling me a little bit about yourself,0
"okay, how long ago did you start playing saxophone",0
Wow that's a long time what other instruments? ,0
"awesome, and you played tenor sax? ",0
"Wow, and how long have you been in marching? ",0
okay great and how do you like marching band?,0
what are your favorite parts about it?,0
okay cool cool and you have a lot of friends who are in band with you? ,0
okay great and then tell me a little bit about your family?,0
okay what kind of dog do you have? ,0
oh nice,0
Charlie ,0
have you had him a long time?,0
oh gosh okay very cool. and what are your plans for after high school?,0
Wow ,0
you've got big dreams. ,0
Alright have you started thinking about schools or majors? I guess you're thinking about psychology,0
alright and how about your grades?,0
okay good very good. Alright well what are the kinds of things do you do for fun on weekends?,0
mhm...when you're hanging out is there ever alcohol sometimes? ,0
so how often do you think you drink alcohol?,0
oh so you're drinking a lot. oh yeah okay and how much are you drinking on the days that you're... on the days that you drink?,0
got it. so you've you've had some pretty heavy drinking. what do you thinks the most you've ever had? like how many drinks?,0
okay so you don't even know. okay so and then your friends drink too?  ,0
"okay, and how much do they typically drink?",0
okay so it's one cup but let's imagine not what I drink a lot of alcohol in it okay. so gosh you're you're actually really drinking quite a lot you know your level of drinking puts you in what we call a high-risk group so is that surprising to you?,0
so we caught high risk because it means that there's actually quite a bit of chances that you're gonna have some bad consequences from drinking like that so you know things like having car accidents or other accidents or getting in fights or you know sexual assault or health problems or developing alcoholism have you thought about those things?,0
"Okay, so it's good because you are not drinking and driving but you're still really drinking a lot and yeah okay so let's let's talk a little bit about that how you might be able to make some changes cuz I think you really need to need to stop drinking like this ",0
so do you think you could quit drinking? or.. ,0
okay so does that mean you're gonna stop drinking?,0
okay cuz you don't sound very much like you think that's gonna work ,0
so how are you gonna quit drinking without your friends thinking you look stupid.. ,0
okay so I mean do you think they're really good friends of yours if they're gonna give you such a hard time?,0
it sounds like you might be better off without them though there yeah maybe not very good friends probably ,0
so so I think we should set a goal that you're gonna stopdrinking and I think you should probably stop as soon as possible like this weekend okay so the way this normally works is you know we set your goal and then I'll have you come back and we'll talk about it again in a couple weeks and make sure that you actually stopped and so what do you think about?,0
okay great so the plan is going to be that you're gonna quit and the friends that you have that you don't think are supportive you're just gonna not hang out with anymore yeah okay and then um you know like are your friends in band drinking?,0
okay so that might be good is really just to focus more on band um cuz you know the other big concern I have for you is if you want to go to medical school you're not ever gonna get into medical school if you're drinking like this yeah you know like college is gonna be really hard and especially without those pre-med classes you're not gonna be able handle it. Drinking this much you know have you thought about that?,0
okay so setting this goal then of quitting drinking is gonna be really helpful for you and it sounds like it shouldn't be that tough really especially because you can just stop hanging out with the people who drink a lot since you have some other friends yeah so do you have any questions for me?or...,0
mm-hmm ,0
well you know one good option would be to just review with them all the bad things about alcohol you can say you know I thought about it and I realized it's gonna mess up my homework and you know it's really a lot of risk for my health I don't want to become an alcoholic you know I don't want to get liver disease I don't want to end up driving drunk or getting into accidents or getting in fights you know one thing you could bring up is I've heard a lot of stories about kids who you know at parties and they're drunk and acting stupid and then people post stuff on Instagram and you know that's it for their social life it's like over,0
I think just tell your friends you know you realize there's all these bad things about it and you don't want to do it anymore so you're just not going to okay and then you can tell them to stop - you know then that'd be really good good news,0
yeah exactly all right any other questions or anything else I can help with?,0
like I said I'll plan to meet with you again in a couple weeks and make sure that you actually quit drinking okay all,0
great   ,0
good morning mrs. Smith just need to get your blood pressure can you roll your sleeve up for me how are you doing today?,0
great... all right your blood pressure's  over ,0
yes ,0
well not always it looks like you got a letter about your ac and you haven't been taking very good care of your diabetes,0
your ac it measures the amount of sugar that's been on your hemoglobin in the last three months to determine how well you've been controlling your blood sugar ,0
it well let's see today it was eight point seven and three months ago it was . so normal is less than six your way out of control ,0
well your health is something you have to make time for. Have you at least been taking your diabetic medications?,0
well it looks like that's not really adequate so you need to be taking your medication. Diet and exercise sometimes just aren't enough your chart says that you've been prescribed metformin which is a long lasting medicine that will keep your blood sugar under control all day. I think would be more effective than just diet and exercise. Are you testing your blood sugar?,0
okay how often?,0
we'll remember your ac was high like I said earlier and that's a much better indicator than how you feel so um it showed that you were out of control if you don't start making changes you could permanently damage your eyesight blood vessels even have to have a foot or leg amputated ,0
I don't think you realize how serious your diseases ,0
just because you feel fine doesn't mean you're healthy having diabetes affects you more than you realize and some people feel fine when they have a big  old sore on their foot ,0
well those are symptoms of high blood sugar but you can have the high blood sugar without those symptoms that's the whole reason for doing an ac to determine if your blood Sugar's been out of control and your ac showed your blood sugar has them out of control ,0
heart medications and diabetic medications are very different you can't generalize the experience your grandfather had to this medication they're completely different. Will we at least try again taking your medications? ,0
well we'll see you in a few months then  ,0
so that's that's something for us to work work through okay,0
because we're not going to solve this crisis in one session,0
let's just set some concrete goals here okay I want to just have some goals for your life I know you have a question you want to answer it goes for your life spit them out goals for your life,0
let's do three for where we want to be at next for next session tangible goals,0
you want you and clarity want clarity I want these to be tangible goals clarity,0
because you're in gaining so it's an FM alexander term are you familiar with the Alexander Technique ya Alexander Technique is a is a body mind meld between I'm not going to explain it is confusing but the point is you can't look at the end result and go I wanna Pam maybe this is regina bundled up without saying i want clarity my life so we want clarity more clarity pure and simple number two,0
number two is that's it number two is like Excel Fisher,0
okay well let's let's let's say your three goals or clarity clarity clarity because it's so important to you,0
alright cool so um so congratulations wait so what we're gonna do find something I like to do the obsessions and I think earned it is I i wrote out some things that I thought really would apply to us so this is something I'm going to tell you about a technique that i developed I used to coach children's sports and you know kids they're always down so hard to be confident you know their bodies are changing blah blah you just do a thing where we give out awards and this was specifically soccer's so these are soccer related awards I thought since it's your first time in therapy that we could do the same for you well based on the award count I have to say that may have been my most successful session because I've never I we're all set so what we're going to do is we're going to just discuss payments always awkward I wasn't comfortable now you since your blog writer you're on the internet you're making a lot of money so I would suggest doing a package,0
well okay that wasn't the agreement we had that was a suggestion that I didn't make I wouldn't call an agreement we had,0
I wouldn't call it,0
I wouldn't I wouldn't call an agreement we had I would call that a suggestion which you inferred which I didn't make,0
my seats the e seat this was called my website implies that it's a free session but that doesn't mean it is,0
horse shit no extortion if you need divine for you is when someone blackmails someone when they have information or forces them to pay money to cover up a multitude of sins would be extortion I'm next door to you no no no no I wanted you to come to the session and I think thank God you did am I right or am i right and I would like you to now compensate me fairly or services rendered,0
Tamlyn,0
the time,0
how are you doing today how are you know I've not seen you for so many months I really won't have it,0
but I was asking how are you doing,0
why would you be doing,0
living,0
yes I understand that well I have an important notice to let you know about and I've heard that you're getting evicted and whether you getting it - do you know how long you have,0
but have you not seen that I've written to you I've taken my time and righteousness to use telling you all about this for what you can do,0
you don't reach your letters,0
you need to have to spend your money wisely honestly you really do like why are you not spending on bills and right that's the most important,0
and what does make you feel good,0
not be prostituting yourself that is not fun something,0
and then you just got down you I don't understand what,0
do you like to feel such views do you not do like to not know what's going on,0
yes that's happened,0
yeah but tell me laid honestly all you need to do is just go the right path to do better for yourself in the future you don't know what's going to happen and you really ought to be lead to better yourself,0
spending start calculating how much money you spend and how much money there you go the whole system thinking,0
trust me,0
I'm personally been in your shoes I used to be a driver,0
no you don't know this I'm telling you it's honestly I used to be drug drug addict myself and trust me it was the hardest point in my life right it is but,0
no I'm not out there helping,0
exactly where you have been honestly I really have and I know exactly what you feel,0
I can't be just mean you can i,0
no,0
I don't give a crap about other people,0
never up crap about me,0
and it's too much and get too confused I can't do all these things you did my hands from me now you can turn it into this,0
okay so why don't you have a rinse David how are you feeling,0
good here take a look see what you think that feeling I mean the colors okay you know there is quite a lot of staining so I'm just wondering about some concerns about smoking possibly,0
coffee tea yeah you've heard this before I'm sure,0
mm-hmm so you know the smoking is gonna be related not just to some of the other negative consequences you know physically it affects dental caries dental cavities,0
healing,0
in your mouth,0
so,0
yes and I really want to be helpful I really want to you know my commitment is to your oral health so there are lots of medications out there David that actually take away a lot of the cravings there they make quitting subtle things,0
yeah,0
No it but David it's not a waste research shows that people take on average about 7 tries before they quit smoking so think of it as your one step closer to quitting,0
well I don't think I'm giving you a lecture is really not what I meant,0
well there's there's a reason that people are concerned,0
no but as I said these medications so you've tried the medication you've been willing once,0
then can I write you a prescription for the medication can we talk about how you could use it because this is something that that's very important not just for your overall physical health even your oral healt,0
oh no the smoking is gonna cause you more problems than the than anything else I can promise you that David the side effects from the medications are nothing compared to what can happen from the smoking,0
like that's the I think thing to really consider,0
I'm okay thank you,0
okay well thanks for listening and honestly I am really worried about the smoking so,0
I'm here to help,0
okay,0
hi Laura so thanks for coming in I'm not sure how much you know about why you're here or what we're supposed to talk about so basically I'm going to be meeting with all the students in the school usually once or twice per semester and we're gonna talk about you know whatever's kind of going on in your life I'll ask you some questions about you know your goals and what you like to do for fun and those sorts of things and then we'll talk a little bit about you know different behaviors and and stuff like that and so it's it's pretty casual pretty informal just sort of a chance for me to get to know you,0
okay why don't we start by just having you tell me a little bit about yourself,0
okay and what do you like to do for fun,0
and when you and your friends are hanging out and what do you do go to ball games go to party,0
okay and what kind of hobbies do you have,0
what are your plans for after high school,0
that's great what do you think you'll study,0
Oh neat,0
yeah that's great that's a really good goal,0
it's a hard work to get into law school are you doing school what kind of grades do you get,0
okay what classes are you not getting A's and B's in,0
oh,0
okay and do you know where you're going to apply to college,0
okay cool and and what made you decide maybe law school or journalism,0
okay great sounds like you have like I said really good goals and you're working hard in school you said that when you're going out with your friends you like to hang out and shop and stuff like that and also go to parties so do you drink alcohol,0
okay and how often do you think you drink,0
mm-hmm so like once or twice a month you're having alcohol,0
okay and so that's maybe like 20 times a year,0
so that's actually kind of a lot of drinking then,0
okay what do you thinks the most you've ever had,0
but you've been drunk before,0
okay so the most you've ever ever had is two drinks in a day,0
okay interesting so do you know all the bad stuff about alcohol,0
okay so one of the things that you know it's really important to talk to teenagers about is drinking and driving so you know that's actually a really big problem and and even around here we have kids die every year from getting in a drunk driving accident so that's something that you really need to make sure you're not doing all right have you ever done that have you ever done,0
okay how much do your friends drink,0
okay,0
what about at these parties you're going to there are other kids there who are drinking a lot,0
and do you hang out with them,0
mm-hmm so you know even just hanging out around kids who are drinking a lot actually puts you at a lot more risk did you know that,0
yeah so there I mean a lot of the other dangers of drinking like not just car accidents we can have other accidents you know people you know will fall or you know break things or a lot of people actually end up breaking their bones and ending up in the emergency room because they've been drunk and fallen down or you know as a girl it's really important too that you're careful because you could be sexually assaulted,0
you know especially if you've been drinking then you know you're at a lot more risk because a guy can take advantage of you did have you thought about that,0
and then you know people get in fights more often when they've been drinking too also you know there have been a lot of kids even at this school gotten in trouble because they were drinking and someone took pictures with their cell phone and put it up on Facebook and then their parents find out or school finds out and you know we have a no tolerance policy here about drugs and alcohol and really can get you into trouble and could put your whole college career in jeopardy have you thought about that,0
but you're still drinking,0
so I mean do you think it's the thing to do if you want to be an attorney,0
okay hmm so I mean I guess what we need to do then is kind of talk about some goals for how to be safer,0
um obviously you shouldn't be drinking at all um what do you think about that,0
so do you think you can quit,0
okay so I'm gonna write down then that you've decided to quit,0
and that's going to be your goal and that's great you know that's really why we're here is to talk about that and make sure that you come to that decision um so I guess can you quit this weekend then,0
okay and then what about your friends who are still drinking,0
okay and what if they won't,0
yeah probably if your friends won't quit drinking you should just find new friends because you know the problem is if they're drinking they're going to pressure you into drinking and then you're going to feel awkward and you know you're going to be stuck and and not know what to do and really just be better off probably without them if they're if they're the kind of people who are going to keep drinking they're probably not a good influence,0
and then then you'll be better set for college too because you know the issue is you're getting good grades now but when you get to college it's a lot harder and you know if you're needing really good grades to get into law school which you will need then you really can't be distracted by alcohol,0
okay so um that's great because it pretty much covers all the stuff that I think I needed to go over with you um let's see I guess we didn't talk about what would happen if your parents found out you were drinking,0
okay so yeah just another reason why you probably need to just quit then um okay yeah okay so like I said I'm gonna write down here that you've decided to quit and you know I'm gonna be meeting with you again probably next semester sometime so we can kind of check in and make sure that you know that's still going well and you're still not drinking and not hanging out with any people who are drinking is there anything else you'd like to talk about while you're here,0
okay um any questions or,0
okay you're sure okay all right um well that's probably it then you can head back to class and and thanks for coming in,0
okay how can I help you,0
see well I would just confirm for me your name again,0
Oh like yes yes I brought you Reducto Reducto actually is no longer recommended and for usin in we lost weight control have you been getting on with it,0
me  you can buy em over the counter Laura doors lower doors tablets II don't need a prescription for them anymore,0
why,0
we can't we can't prescribe anything reducta was the the one that was  was prescription on the medicine and we can no longer prescribe that guidance recommends that we no longer prescribe that for people because it's actually shown to increase the cardiovascular risk and actually I noticed from your last visit that your blood pressure was a little bit high I don't think you should be taking any medicines because the bottom line is actually from what you're telling me is it's not helping you to lose weight it's helping you to maintain your weight and maintaining your weight should be something that you do through diet and exercise anyway this is artificially maintaining your weight well it has actually been recent guidance over the last month or so 9 to 6 weeks tips sometimes tears I bet to filter through but we've been told unequivocally that we're not allowed to prescribe this anymore when you take your prescription to clap pharmacist they won't fill it and you really do need to be joining Weight Watchers there's been an article there's been an article in the in the BMG just a couple of weeks ago that shows that actually joining and group a Weight Watchers group or the equivalent it's much more effective long term well I'm sorry there's no choice it's a much it's much more because it's less there's less and drug in it it's less effective but then consequently it's also less dangerous so you can buy them or less stop and or you can join wheight Watchers I know I know and I can appreciate that but it's your diet and exercise that's the important thing you need to get yourself softer down well I think you might find that you possibly are eating more than you think and if you joined Weight Watchers or equivalent slimming world etc then you possibly would be encouraged to do a food diet  and you might find that you're eating more than you there's nothing more I can do for you we cannot prescribe Reducto anymore the recommendation is join a Weight Watchers group or Slimming World Group and just modify your diet and increase your exercise that is the only way that you are going to lose weight I'm really sorry that I'm unable to because there must be well that is the recommendation that's the guidelines if you're very welcome to go and make an appointment with another doctor but you will get the same message from them as you're getting from me and I'm sorry if I appeared on some pathetic however the bottom line is diet and exercise is what you need to do in order to lose weight and to maintain your weight,0
if you're doing what you've always done then you're always going to get what you get so if you already eat and you've all been back but the only reason that you're maintaining your weight is because of the deductr,0
no I'm saying that you need to be looking at your whole lifestyle which is diet and exercise I'm really sorry that I'm unable to help you today please feel free to make an appointment with another GP you,0

yeah I'll tell you what I'll call you only we have an open,0

okay well I'll tell you what I'll call you when we have a spot of it if you boy time you can come if you don't then I'll just assume that you ran off to Minnesota and got all your problems solved out,0
all right nice to meet you TM every day,0
Can I help you ,0
so you want nicotine replacement but you don't want to quit smoking ,0
we don't really recommend that the ideas you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit so then you wouldn't be smoking at work but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either ,0
okay well smoking really is really bad for you you know it causes things like lung cancer emphysema heart disease ,0
well to be honest with you you mentioned the patch I can't recommend a patch to you if you're gonna continue smoking that can actually be pretty dangerous for you in order to advise you about this at all I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now ,0
okay well we actually considered  cigarettes a day to be a significant amount and in fact I would then recommend to you that you would start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement,0
I mean do you have there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings and probably the gum would be the best option for you it's not something you would continue to use continuously throughout the day however the gum is something you use just when you have a craving ,0
well we have that here but again the the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking ,0
aside from the gum you could try the nicotine lozenge that would be another option for you again that's not something you'd want to use continuously throughout the day the nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement but again that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke ,0
hi Chris,0
so yeah I was looking over your survey that you filled out for like that you're presently not using a kind of birth control particularly condoms ,0
okay so can you tell me tell me why you don't use condoms ,0
so Chris did you know that condoms are really kind of the best way for males to protect themselves against sexually transmitted infections to prevent you know males from becoming team fathers and also to prevent things like HIV did you know that those are some things that condoms do for you not specifically ,0
oh okay um well you know the statistics of teen pregnancy are really high and a lot of the reason is because you know people like yourself aren't using condoms to protect themselves I also want to tell you that condoms are really easy to get you know you can get them at your health departments you can buy them at any pharmacy it's really easy to do you can carry them in your backpack you know they're small packages you can put them in your pocket you can keep them in your car so they're really really easy to use they're really really effective and you know there's really no reason why someone like yourself shouldn't be using condoms if you're going to choose to be sexually active are you yourself ready to be a teen father is that something that you're looking to do ,0
okay okay well I really need you to commit to using condoms because it sounds like you you know aren't ready to be a teen father I'm assuming you don't want any of these infections that are very prevalent so I really need you to tell me today that you're going to you know try this out and make a commitment to change and become a healthier person can you do that I mean I've got real items here reckon I can give you one to take with you is that that's what you want ,0
So we talked a lot about the way your medications are working or not working or not working I have some suggestions I think that we need to start with really clean up a lot of your medication so the opiates aren’t really working for you and I'm really concerned because the dose you are at. I suppose you are taking too much Tylenol.,0
There are Tylenol in the Percocet and you can reach a limit that actually damage your liver so there's some concerns there. Also the opiates that you are taking are above what we call the watchful though so that can actually increase your risk of dying relating to take an opioid that much overtime. ,0
"well he should know, but he’s new, so maybe he doesn’t know. Anyways he send you to us and we are really the experts in the area, so we can make all these recommendations and he can work with you to carry this out. So first of all we are gonna take down your dose of Oxycodone. Second of all, we need to relook at the medications you are on firstly. All these different medications interrupt with each other.",0
"So it’s just all this medication tie together. You don’t have to worry about anything, we are gonna be making recommendations to take care of everything. But to be honest, I can even believe that you are still awake while you are here. Like this is probably snowing you while you don’t realize. Did you drive here? ",0
"It’s really hard to explain, it’s really complex. But trust me, we are going to make the recommendation, and you just need to follow it step by step. Everything should be fine.     ",0
hi Deborah how are you today ,0
you came he did ok today so I was told to come in to talk to you from social worker so your social worker today so what's going on ,0
they just didn't send me for a reason to the hospital to go talk to you ,0
can you tell me a little about the bruises on you ,0
you're clumsy a little bit do to get stitches on you ,0
so how can you explain how you fell down your shirt ,0
were you holding anything like a basket or ,0
she just tripped over the lifted rugged fell down stairs there's other bruises though to how did you get those baby asked ,0
so I'd say that you're always falling do you know what can stop that ,0
so your husband's always expand your clumsy rushing into things ,0
how long have you been married for ,0
how are you guys doing both you ,0
hope you all ready you seem a little off edge when I asked you about that well ,0
obviously it is it the brush to the hospital to get stitches so it has to be a big deal ,0
you want to go home already what's that home for you to eat a rush ,0
this is it everyday thing that you had to watch your time limit with him ,0
why is he paranoid  you came get help for yourself,0
are you hiding something for him or you covering up for him ,0
so was he the one that gave this stitches made you fall down stairs why,0
he ho that's a crime for him doing pushing you down the stairs ,0
no but you're the one that ended up with injury but he did it,0
it's normal that he do this all the time to you ,0
you deserve to be hit no one deserves to be did every way should we treat it nice rich respect and loyalty from her husband you should have to cover up for him ,0
do you want to talk about apply to help you so does it happen again ,0
you could be safe at places there are homes there's family members there's a police restraining orders he can't stay away from you ,0
we can also get you groups that will really willing to help you get through this time that will help you look for jobs if you need a job or help you with food or shelter clothing ,0
sometimes in life styles we don't need we could change that you have to adjust to some things instead of being somewhere you're being abused and not being happy anymore you can go somewhere where you are happy it's going to be a different lifestyle for you but it's going to be a better life as well,0

if you get you out of that situation now and get you the help you need as we could feel safe and you're not happen to you again ,0

rainy Beckett I'm a nurse practitioner,0
nice to meet you. tell me uh what brings you in today ,0
okay so you have a sore throat and a cough ,0
and when did this start?,0
yes so it just started today then ,0
okay so tell me a scale of zero to ten where zero is no pain at all on ten is like take me to the emergency room where would you say the pain is?,0
it's any pain ,0
so you said you needed antibiotics ,0
okay well I'll tell you what why don't I uh examine you first and let's see what that okay shows up and then we'll decide what we're going to do ,0
all right so sandy we did an exam and you do have some redness in the back of  your throat but there's no pus or white stuff or anything back there and your ears look okay and your eyes look okay you don't have this to hurt just a little bit right I understand and you have you don't have any swollen nodes or lymph nodes or glands in your neck or anything and your lungs sound clear and your heart sounds great okay so this is probably a virus and for a virus you don't need antibiotics ,0
uh no because you don't need them and now a friend where I work,0
okay so you work at CVS ,0
in the pharmacy?,0
oh okay ,0
okay all right well I'll tell you with a virus a virus the antibiotics don't do any good so I just suggest you take some ibuprofen like  milligrams every  to  hours for the pain and then gargle with some salt water and a tablespoon of honey and some hot tea will help but this will probably just go away in  or  days and you don't need any antibiotics ,0
well if you don't need them then you know part of my job is to tell you what's best for you so ,0
well I'm sorry but that's you know that's your option I'll just send you the bill so sandy we did yours  ,0
professor can I come in ,0
yeah have a seat I'll be with you in a second well what is it ,0
take one of these handouts on my desk ,0
it's a list of classes that students taking this major cross off the ones you've already taken it choose from the ones that are left,0
I'm guessing if you're in my microbiology class this semester you're ready to take these next classes right ,0
what do you want to do with your major ,0
oh you want to save the kittens and puppies on very nice well you're gonna have to be a much better student if you want to do that or just about anything else in this field anyway the sheets go to the classes you can take so study hard I'll see you in class okay  ,0
wanted to talk to you because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures that are kind of concerning to me of you and some of your friends at a party and you know you're such a good kid like I don't know what you're doing drinking it's gonna ruin your life ,0
Kate on occasion but whenever the opportunity presents itself it it's nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes otami there's so many consequences with drinking you know you're not even  yet you could get arrested you could you know have a drunk driving accident you could you know mess up your schoolwork you have such a bright future ahead of you it just really really concerns me ,0
there's really no such thing as not drinking too much I mean anything that's drinking when you're under age is drinking too much you know like think about it think about all the things that can happen to you. yeah I understand exactly what you're saying and how much are you drinking? ,0
I'm just so concerned you know can't you think of anything better to do?,0
and I do get where you're coming from and is are your friends the problem like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you're partying with ,0
well there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice right that's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what's best for you and I just you know I really think you should think about making a big change here ,0
I think you really need to quit ,0
I think you're wrong you know it really worries me anyway I wish you would quit if all you're gonna do is cut down that's better than nothing you know I appreciate you talking to me about this but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it it's really important ,0
do you want to wait for that to happen do you want to wait for a dramatic experience?,0
all right well maybe it's something we can work on together and you know I think we should come up with a plan it's going to work for you so that you can get control here and stop drinking ,0
okay sounds good by starting the  ,0
so cars at the time anyway I'm late so what do you want to wear,0
do you like it better mommy sent me,0
I don't did I he's sticky send me an email during the wake about something that happened,0
yeah I'm not sure whether I got I saw something mom you look it's just me nuts I hope something really really crazy,0
yeah yeah yeah but anyway back to you,0
something about an incident that happened with the quad,0
yeah yeah,0
I'm sure that's sort of listen yeah,0
quit that woman,0
and you told her heart she's she's hard work isn't she that's what I heard her years ago girly,0
yeah,0
yeah yeah yeah,0
was at the meeting up on the third floor that on the Thursday where everybody came and busted Eden,0
not heard about it,0
apparently that was really funny,0
of course he'll get off the scope I've got this on meetings ah typical sorry they're actors clients right but anyway back to you,0
no no no because I've got clients that I've got stuff going on at home I don't want to talk about God,0
no no no video more where were you're just as important and you've got this seem to tell me about,0
II it's coming up geez bloody reception and look they're telling me that the clients threatening to leave if I don't go down now no looks tougher no they can leave anyway,0
no no it's fine back to you,0
no no no no no no we got hope heaps of time I decided that you're really meeting with the clients that I know so did you did you just tell them what the story was they're just gotta stop doing what they're doing,0
so you just start doing what to say to them did you just say you've got to stop arguing why didn't you say just stop arguing,0
yeah we're gonna learn these things,0
can you just say stop arguing you don't need a super person you've just got to take control,0
none really there's none it's not look the thing is you're going to be assertive with those clients you just got to tell them what's going on play it it'll save you a lot of time,0
what else we got in your agenda,0
okay um which part,0
so telling me you would have got a going to get somebody else to come back,0
to be fired for tendance know about him,0
yeah yeah look it sounds like you did a terrific job,0
here,0
you know you thought about the process,0
okay,0
yeah yeah well we kind of times up and I have got so much work to look can you help me this afternoon I've just got some case notes that I really need done I need only I've got a heap of families that they bring up I'm just not going to get to and I've been going to leave at 3:00 because I've got to go and see a friend who's in hospital so can you help me out with them,0
oh come on you can do that,0
for what,0
say my name is Sally she'll do them you can come with makers I really like some help with some Agnew and hunger off you,0
supposedly is exactly the word supposedly is the key word yes okay,0
let's see how much we make within the video let's leave let's leave let's see what you got we move on audition here we'll see really um really it comes down to how good you make me look,0
so,0
let's see about that there's a whole different motivation here a little bit my cessation here's what even agent yeah yeah I'm yeah maybe you guys can talk okay um I think I'm actually going to go ahead and just do it let's see okay so um and in his name,0
Dennis okay alright and just so just substance abuse treatment counseling who knows exactly why he's here so,0
so Dennis,0
alright well um so I got a little bit of information as to why you're here but but maybe you can go ahead and just tell me,0
Wow okay so she's doing pretty tough stance on it,0
okay all right so pretty important to you I mean she's taking the stance on it your kids have said similar things,0
and now you're here I mean it's gotten point that you've you agreed to go ahead and go into treatment she's saying not just get treatment she's saying quit I mean Jesus she's being pretty,0
out of about it okay so what do you think,0
yeah,0
oh,0
all right,0
what's always you feel you know I mean it's like you know you work you you're responsible you do what you think is expected of you and so it kind of feels a little unfair to you know you're a man you're a head of the household you know you're doing your duty and it feels a little unfair to have people trying to dictate your behavior and telling if you've got to give this up,0
yeah no no,0
wouldn't what to do,0
all right all right well so I guess that's kind of the that's the dilemma I guess you know on the one hand she's uh she's very out of it she's very concerned and is making her expectation very clear on the other hands you know you're being asked to give up something that you don't particularly want to give up um what do you think what do you think she's what you put why do you think she's so concerned,0
yeah,0
yeah yeah certainly it's you know people can tell you what they want,0
you know and but all ultimately it's up to your choice what you're gonna do so you know she she can threaten you and she can she can tell you that you know if you don't do this she can you know she's gonna leave and she can leave you know it sounds like you really don't really don't want that but but you know everybody's got their choices to make in this situation okay so she's concerned about your health and has pointed out that you have a you know your father so he drank and that's but,0
okay,0
so I don't know so you're not sure if that,0
okay,0
so you're not sure if that played a role in his heart attack or not,0
so you're not sure about how well you know he died did it earlier and she points that out as evidence that like you've got media genetic predisposition to having health related problems associated with drinking,0
okay,0
okay so it almost seems like evidence to the opposite they told you to quit drinking 20 years ago and here you are it's still alive then,0
yeah,0
surely,0
yeah,0
okay,0
yeah,0
okay max,0
okay huh,0
so it's kind of you know the state you know you have this determination you're the kind of person that you know you you do what you trust your gut and you do what you think you should do and you know you work real really hard and you and you've had a lot of success in your life,0
it seems like in your in your job and and and with your family the fact that you're a married man with kids and you know you've raised them up and you know I think there's no denying that you had a lot of success in real life in it and and you know and you know better than anyone how hard you had to work could she be back so um and,0
okay,0
okay okay all right so she's got all these concerns about it how do you and you mentioned your kids have some concerns - they talk about it I mean what is your sense of and it sounds like so far you feel like well I've beaten the odds and I'm this kind of guy like I'm always a kind of guide it sort of pushes the envelope and you know has proven a lot of people wrong over the years and so you're very skeptical when anyone tells you that drinking is going to kill you like,0
it's almost like if somebody tells you that you're gonna say you know you're not gonna believe that I mean you just don't believe that's the truth,0
okay okay all right so what so what if anything in what they're telling you do you believe it turns out like a possible negative effects that I may have obviously it has not killed you you're standing here right now,0
okay so as it killed you but do you think but have you seen any do you think there's anything to anything any validity to what your wife is saying your kids and the doctors with regards to having a negative effect on your health or otherwise I mean just just very honestly if you sit there and you look back and kind of go well and is there anything that you think that is going on that that it's valid right now,0
no no I mean confidentiality is such that no I want you to know I'd never feel comfortable talking,0
okay,0
well you know gosh I really appreciate the Jew did you feel comfortable sharing with me to know who those things with me and and I can see that you know this has been very painful and I just I can't commend you enough for being willing to put yourself out there and come in and trust this process it's not easy to do so I really appreciate the fact that you've done that,0
alright okay thank you very much,0
okay help you,0
so you want nicotine replacement but you don't want to quit smoking maybe like that during the day nicotine replacement is that I mean,0
we don't really recommend that the ideas you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit so then you wouldn't be smoking at work but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either,0
well smoking really is really bad for you you know it causes things like lung cancer emphysema heart disease,0
well to be honest with you you mentioned the patch I can't recommend a patch to you if you're going to continue smoking that can actually be pretty dangerous for you in order to advise you about this at all I need you to tell me a little more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now,0
okay well we actually considered 20 cigarettes a day to be a significant amount and in fact I would then recommend to you that you would start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement,0
there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings and probably the gum would be the best option for you it's not something you would continue to use continuously throughout the day however the gum is something you use just when you have a craving,0
well we have that here but again the the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking,0
aside from the gum you could try the nicotine lozenge that would be another option for you again that's not something you'd want to use continuously throughout the day the nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement but again that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke,0
okay,0
hi,0
okay and is it for Molly,0
okay hi hi how are you doing,0
good well would you mind taking a seat I have a couple things I want to go over with you about this medication,0
okay well this should only take a few minutes so before we get started I just want to make sure I still got all the correct information so you're still on Emma Street with the same phone number and everything right,0
okay so nothing's changed wonderful um now I was taking a look at your medication profile earlier and it looks like you're on two different strengths of lipitor so that obviously can't be right,0
okay so do you remember which one you're taking,0
you don't know okay I think you're taking the 10 milligram tablets it's not right,0
okay okay so the doctor gave you this new prescription but there's new medication is that right,0
okay okay so this medication is for your cholesterol,0
and you're going to take it once a day it's really important that you take it every day all right and you can take it with her without food it doesn't really matters yes once a day,0
okay and now the doctor did tell you this was your cholesterol right C yeah he said that's why I checked my blood last time that's why I was in for a visit right,0
right exactly so that's why he wrote you this prescription so it's greater cholesterol you're just gonna take it once a day it's really easy C okay,0
there are some side effects that go along with this medication but I wouldn't really worry about it because I mean you're young you're healthy it's not an issue so don't concern yourself with it okay all right so just to make sure that I didn't miss anything I'm just gonna repeat everything again to make sure you got it first time,0
all right so this medication is for your cholesterol you're gonna take it once a day you can take it with a lot of water and you want to make sure you don't miss any doses okay,0
okay what questions do you have any questions at all,0
okay well if that's it I guess you can go ahead now so here's your prescription,0
all right have a nice day,0
yeah well you know I got this uh I got this new girl spoke to on the phone and she sounds she sounds annoying you know she's one of those miners there she she's got like that that tone in her voice I just but y'all good or what I do i do i do what i do for a reason you know I help people but uh it's just is it gets annoying especially this one she sounds sounds muddy whoa whoa,0

shut your mouth it's not about you right now you are disturbing I office,0
okay well you know will agree to disagree how about that,0
all right you know what forget what I said let's just get down to business okay so let's get started why are you here,0
sheesh well let me start by saying I'm happy you opened up to me I'm glad you're warming up but I didn't ask for your life story I didn't ask for it it's not it's not just don't getting the frenzy so basically I hope that your vagina isn't as loose as your mouth is because you've set a lot of stuff to me about off of that,0
why don't we start how about we start over let's let's try this again no tension I could tell,0
I'm really depressed and then you call me disturbed made matters worse so I'm thinking that maybe I should go on medication I don't know what do you think,0

um okay so that overdose love to talk about um so then why are you feeling depressed?,0
you're like - I looked in your chart and your life doesn't seem all that bad so this depression I think you can get over it um yeah let me like my notes here no song oh hey yeah can I talk to you later I'm gonna finish on there okay um sorry I lost my train of thought my my notes here you got booze overdose um so can you talk about these thoughts? oh that like that what area do you want to do? um very still having those thoughts no no okay then great no that's because I know I mean if you're having them it's kind of like why I don't understand what people think of like it so it's really very weak them to do personally but any who is oh hold on a second hello no I'm at work right now yeah you know at Belmont yeah I want to talk with this patient here yeah I'll call you back okay okay all right yeah anyhoo so let me look at my notes but so you those thoughts were saying who are you saying about those? did you have that? I forget oh no no okay okay that's great I'm glad so are you feeling better than yeah so what do you think has worked in your therapy ,0
okay what do you want me to see if your doctors available? I can totally arrange that okay I'm going to go check that then,0
"I have useful I Russia on a black civic concern and I see that your doctor referred you to come to me so not referred me so I can speak you about your weight, is that is that right?",0
could you explain thin detail? why you think so? so do you know the up as the risk of being being like overweight or obese?,0
okay that's I mean I agree with you do you know what kind of risks or like the obesity will lead to? ,0
"overall, obesity can lead to many chronic conditions. such as hypertension diabetes heart diseases, if you loss weight, it will lessen the risk of getting these diseases and a five a five to ten percent weight loss would really improve that. so what do you say? ",0
"so I just stated that unity you're willing to to set some goals, so what kinds of goals  are you are you thinking of?",0
yeah so let's start with this so what do you typically eat in the day? ,0
okay so uh so what do you mean that was you don't eat that much or whatever's there?,0
so wait so if you eat five tacos and some..?,0
"Sorry, I just want to clarify. okay and so so on a scale from one to ten how ready are used to make some changes in your in your eating habits or paths?",0
why do you think it's hard?,0
no so you say that i'm not going to tell you so so you said that you on a scale of one to ten you're going the fastest it lets you choose five to six so you're you're ready for a change why do you choose five to six? why is it not a four or even ,0
so you you want to lose right but you you just you just really like breads and carbohydrates and like you can't stay away from that?,0
so you've tried some diets before and they haven't worked out and since you're a single mom with kids is it's been hard for you to cook meals or do grocery shopping?,0
yeah so I said you said you stated that you pick up the basic food that does mean?,0
okay do you have anyone in your life of a family or friends to help you with that?,0
so what kinds of meals does your mom cook?,0
"okay, so you do like cabbages? so you said green beans and cabbage and some vegetables. are you, so do you like vegetables?",0
oh ok that's really good so are you willing to incorporate more vegetables in your diet or eating paths?,0
so you said you eat vegetables. so how much of vegetables or serving do you eat in a day?,0
so you said you eat lettuce and tomatoes. Is there anything else you eat? so do you put any of anything on the salad?,0
oh ok that's good it sounds like you are really concerened your weight and you want to make changes in your life. are you ready to set some goals to try and follow them? ,0
sure so okay so one of the goals could be since you said you like vegetables and a variety of them you can try to adapt.. have you heard of the myplate or choose my plate?,0
yeah okay so this is how my plate is it's kind of a place and then a half of it and usually you can fill your play with fruits fruits and vegetables and then a quarter of your plate can be protein it could be beings it could be fish beef chicken and then the other half of the other corner is grain ,0
right and I'm like a sea of my foes or bread or like starch and then you can also it can all there's also like a cup of milk that you can incorporate in your in your meal so how does that sound?,0
yeah yeah it's really easy I don't like to continue can help you can hold the plate and it's salso good comes on like I mean like what size of raisins and some but as long as like each other you know two fistfuls of vegetables that shows that it's half the plate and then one fifth in like three ounces of me and that kid stuff that shows that and then the others and greens and carved and yeah wouldn't or decent anything ,0
I can also give you a hat a lot of a handle or or or brochure that shows you the actual plant and you can put it in your mic on your refrigerator and that will help you you know ,0
"that's great I'm glad that we're up work for every one another yeah so and and I also remember that you,  so what you think? so it shows carbs and stuff.",0
i can also give you a handout or bouchoure that shows you actually plate and you can put it on your refigirator ,0
so yeah so if they just don't have time you just looked last time preparing breakfast is you also have your kids to like help them get ready for school on them and you thought of every father preparing breakfast the night before no I haven't yet it's really easy and you can practice there are a lot of breakfast foods and like other healthy option healthier options that you can you can try such as like you do you like ed yeah like you can incorporate protein with it it eats like eating eggs and also you can put up the night before you can cut up some fruit and so you can have them ready for the next morning and eating it with yogurt do how do you feel about your hair yeah so I've been acting like groups with fellow like we slept on goal here you're gonna you're going to try to incorporate more vegetables up top you like showed you the MyPlate guidelines and and you've also you're also trying and you're going to try to prepare breakfast with the night before or less and yeah I'm so glad that like began to me so I can help you and it was my advice of talking to to thank you and I yes thank you  ,0

the bacteria actually use the sugar that's in your mouth to create acids and it's these acids that eat through the tooth surfaces to cause holes so you could say the more the teeth are coated in sugar the more likely it is that you're going to get holes if we're able to chat a little bit more about your diet I might be able to help you so that we can reduce the risk of you needing fillings in the future ,0
okay it sounds like you're not ready to chat about this today is that okay with you if we have this conversation at some point in the future,0
okay great I'll make sure I make a note in your file and then if it's okay with you next time you come in we won't be able to pick up where we left off today you've got a lot in your mind and I don't really want to overwhelm you some people actually like to jot down the sorts of things they've been eating and drinking and bring it into the next visit or have actually seen some really great apps on smart phones where you can record this sort of information really easily it's up to you of course I'll leave it to you to think about you  ,0
So what did the doctor tell you about this medication?,0
"Okay so I wouldn’t worry about that. If you want him to be an athlete, it’s probably more important to worry about him breathing clearly than it is to worry about his height.   ",0
so what you told me earlier was that you've got into a car with someone you knew had smoked marijuana earlier what were you thinking ,0
science fair project or not don't you know what happens when someone drives under the influence of marijuana or alcohol it's bad they can wreck the car you can lose your life I thought you were smart you're taking AP classes you want to get into Ivy League school this is not the way you do that ,0
it's a big deal you can't drink either you're  the drinking age is  I think you know that you could get into an auto crash I just want you to hear this I don't tolerate as a doctor drinking or driving with somebody who's under the influence and if you do it again I'm going to tell your parents  ,0
hey  see you round here ,0
so how you been doing,0
so any particular reason why you're here I had called you into several meetings haven't seen you ,0
it wouldn't happen to be about the eviction notice ,0
it does concern me I want to help you our council told me that you're being evicted in three days ,0
it would be possible to stay in your apartment if you paid your rent,0
if you open them up and pay them it would help ,0
I really tried to help you on this several times yeah,0
what's happened I mean you were doing so great we got out of rehab you had everything under control you were showing up to the meetings I knew what was happening yeah well I don't know,0
you're spending it on drugs ,0
are you on drugs again ,0
listen I really want to help you I want to help you I really try to help you I don't in your shoes once yeah I really want to help you ,0
I don't want to see you on the streets none of us want to see you on the streets prostituting yourself because you need dope you were doing so well yeah well,0
I really wish you had come to me sooner I really really want to help you on this yeah,0
I know I mean I know you've been in rehab several times I was myself until it worked but it worked eventually and I really really think the same can happen for you really yeah ,0
I want to help you up and it would be great if we could start off by actually seeing you at these meetings ,0
I really want to help you out on this ,0

Now are you on the pill?,0
"You're not on the... You're not on the pill?  What are you thinking?  What? Is your, is your head not attached to your body or something? Eh?",0
The nerve.  Going all willy nilly with some guy and you're not even on the pill.  What do you? What do you even? Uh these children now-a-days. It's so ....,0
"Okay.  So just hold on, hold on. Ya. Lulu, I just got Alexis here.  She thinks she's pregant.  I'm going to need about ten minutes. Okay? Ten minutes.  Alright.  Great.  Yes. Okay.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Yes.",0
"Stupid? You're stupid? Sheesh.  I don't know.  I just don't know. You know you would swing the, the...  You don't even know how, how difficult life could be, yeah?  Life, my girl, life is tough.  I mean, you just saw, I've got meetings to go to. I've got things to do in the evenings.  Life is difficult my girl.  You've got to take...You've got to learn to take responsibility.  My life.   If you knew how difficult my life can be, yeah.",0
"Oh please. You think you...you think you have him? You don't have him.  Let me tell you a thing girl.  You don't have that guy. Uh, huh.  I know his type.  He's out there.  He's out there with the other girls and he's probably impregnated about three by now. Huh? You're just one of the lot. Don't think you've got him. You don't have him.",0
"Okay, just hold on, hold on.",0
"Okay. Sht. Wants to save him. Um.  Okay, Alright. I know what. I know what to do.  You just leave everything to me.  You don't worry.  Alright.  Look.  Look.

Here's a name of a person and a telephone number.  You phone them.  Phone them. That's it.  That's it.  You keep that number.  Don't worry about your family okay.",0
"What, what are you saying? Are you trying to say that I'm wrong?  Uh, heh, don't, don't do that.  Don't do that. I'm not wrong gir. I know what I'm doing. You just, you find that number and, and, and they will, they will help you. Don't you question what I'm doing.  Alright. Okay.  You find that number.",0
All the best. All the best. Okay. That's it.  That's it. There you go. ,0
"Why, what happened?",0
Well how long ago did this all begin?,0
Well have you been taking your Rubiff reguarly?,0
Well when did you stop taking it?,0
So your symptoms may be because you stopped your drug?,0
I think you should go back on the drug. We know from clinical trial that it helps to slow progression. Going off it is only going to make things worse.,0
"Well, the data's clear! I think the first thing we need to do is get you back on the drug. We also need to change the way you're thinking about your MS and the drug. Drug's not a cure. It's only gonna slow progression. You know if you weren't on this drug, your symptoms would've come back sooner. And you need to think of the last two years that you've had without major symptoms as a success.",0
"I know, I see this all the time with my patients.",0
"I wouldn't say ""normal"". MS is different for everyone.",0
Well that's hard to say. So I'll see you in three months and you can start going back on the drug. Any questions?,0
I can great to see you today nice to see you too so I understand your smoker and I wonder if you would talk with me about your smoking?,1
all right and so can you describe for me your pattern of tobacco use?,1
so how many cigarettes would you say that you have you smoked each day?,1
okay and how soon after you wake up in the mornings do you have your first cigarette?,1
well it seems like you have a lot of awareness of your triggers for smoking ,1
and so those times when you decide to quit what are your reasons for quitting?,1
but it seems like it really fits in with your lifestyle with the friends that you spend time with and,1
yeah well it sounds like it's really it helps you to connect with them and part of socializing ,1
it also sounds like when you're really feeling bad or feeling negative emotions that it's the one thing that you know you can go to and for a little while anyways it helps you to feel better ,1
let's stop here so we can discuss what you have seen so far consider the following questions how do you think this conversation is going so far? how effective is the assessment? are there other questions you want to ask? what have we learned so far about Kens smoking pattern and history? what are your initial thoughts about potential tobacco cessation medications and counseling strategies? let's see what happens next and so right now in this moment can you talk with me about you know how ready are you to quit? so on a scale from one to ten one being not ready to quit it all and ten being you know you would set a quit date right now where are you? c	 at huh you know I would say maybe six or seven i would say I'd be I'd be happy to be done you know I'd be happy if I didn't ever smoke again I just I just don't really believe it's going to happen I guess you know I like I said I quit all the time and now it's even sort of a joke that that me Quinton's like not quitting at all it just means I'm out  t	um okay well did you know though that um people who quit without any sort of assistance using any tobacco cessation medications or counseling have a four percent chance of success of quitting in the long term ,1
um but there are some cessation medications and aids that can really help you to successfully quit ,1
well there are things like um the patch or the gum so nicotine replacement therapy there's also other medications as well as counseling where it could really help you learn and practice some strategies to help you stop smoking especially at those times when you're really triggered or you have some real cravings they'd have to be really good techniques,1
so so then that leaves me to asking you about your confidence level so if you could rate yourself your confidence level about your ability to quit on a scale from one to ten one being not having any confidence at all and ten being yeah I know I can do it this time where are you at with that ,1
yeah well and so can you talk with me a bit more about the reasons why you would really want to be quit?,1
yeah um is there anything else that really you know is one of the reasons why you would want to quit?,1
so it really does sound like for you quitting smoking would be an expression a self love ,1
yeah and so your confidence you said is that a two or three why not a one ,1
well it sounds like quitting smoking is really important to you but that you know you don't really feel confident and you're not sure about what strategies are out there to help you and I'm wondering if you'd be willing to meet and talk with one of our tobacco treatment specialist who can we tell you what your options are get you connected to resources to help you quit would you be willing to do that? ,1
yeah well in like you said you know you've quit many times before and for multiple days and that is a real success and I know that because you ended up going back to smoking that it doesn't feel like a real success but certainly being able to stop for hours or days at a time is really an accomplishment and I hope you can feel that ,1
okay so if I connect you with them with the tts you'll um follow up with them and talk with them about it?,1
in our next meeting we can check in and see how things went for you ,1
okay well wonderful great talking with you it's good talking you  ,1
Brooklyn hi it's good to meet you I see you've made yourself comfortable ,1
so thanks for coming you today it's good to meet you Emily yes so would you like to tell me why why you came here today ,1
she's your mom thinks you're on the computer too much spending too much time why have them here yes and you don't think ,1
well tell me a little bit about what you like to do on the computer ,1
yeah something a little bit about that do you have a character that you roleplay ,1
do you think Lily the dark angel princess you think there's any of that character of you do you see yourself in Lily ,1
so it sounds like there's very similar stories to you Lily the character on my breath yes and you also said you like to YouTube ,1
well you say cheerful funny so it's a lot of fun yes ,1
yeah so I'm talking to you gee what I hear is your mother thinks you're on the computer too much yep you don't think that's true you seem to be enjoying yourself that around here yes does your mom know that you're having fun when you're on the computer,1
mm-hmm so your mom interrupts what are the race some of the reasons that she interrupts you probably from you throw something away go to track and one where she was nows on the opposite side of the house and let's I think that's the main one so your mom asks you to throw away things unnecessarily do something that,1
mm-hmm so she doesn't need me mmm just like a little much hmm he has more energy so do you usually spend time on the computer alone in your room or where's the computer in your house ,1
so when your mama drugs you you said you have to pause the game when you get frustrated,1
it all if you can imagine why your mom's doing that what do you think would be her reason for interrupting you so that hard way see but doesn't have to get up mmm because you have to tell me hmm I understand watching well it's frustrating yes well it sound like you care what your mom thinks ,1
yeah so your mom interrupts you when you're on the computer um and she ever taken your computer with you or tried to stop you from playing with appear ,1
so how did it feel when you couldn't play with your xbox you couldn't play with your computer you couldn't look under candle you couldn't play with your phone you can watch TV it sounds like you were left without most of the things you enjoy the most yeah how does it feel ,1
mmm couldn't wait ain't no because when you have notebooks like all the books you have our books are very red don't want to read anymore because like you just think of the whole story three head all right just don't let the book in general you look like fences for drawing hi there's nothing to do you will explode mm-hmm do you have any ideas of things you could do or alternative ways to spend your time how did you handle that those three days without your computer ,1
so you have three days without your electronics how are you able to do your homework ,1
well I've met quite a few children who have trouble finding alternative ways to spend their time besides electronics most of us are on our phones or on the computer or emailing each other I'm sure you have texting I'm sure you have a lot of homework you have to get done on the computer typing paper and only you can decide what interests you oh it's essential I used to come here mmm so it's necessary right if you want to be a game developer you feel like this is a learning experience for you to get used to play on computer so that you can actually bring it into your professional life later hmm there's your mom realizes,1
mmm so you told her many many times yes attention was missing well she didn't work mmm sipping yeah so it sounds like you you feel like she's not listening to you she's always on her fault she could have no face bone why should people calling people up up mhm she have to go to schoo,1
oh thanks Emma told Anthony so when you get home from seven hours of school five days a week plus you like to chill with your computer that's your way relaxing it sounds like yes and also I heard you say that you see your mom on her phone all the time so eats the fact that she's playing on facebook and texting while she's telling you not to be on computer seems very hypocritical to you,1
mmm you're angry yes so back to when you you had those three days about electronics you shared that you're reading books or you look back and you wish that you had had certain books during yes let's just say you had a chance to go back those three days and take fun things to do with you bit work relays your phone that weren't related to watching something on TV or netflix urn will get youtube or your kindle let's just imagine that we could go in time and take some fun ideas for things to do this in those three days in fact if you wouldn't mind I could share something with you that I've shared with other kids who have trouble thinking of things to do would you like to show you,1
okay so here's a list and every person has their own preference for what they think is interesting your hobbies and that's what's amazing about how different we all are so no no see the dirt just there's something on that list it popped out you something looks fun something that you can't stay I'm doing this is just a general list of things that people do with your time reading and drawing listen to music ,1
do you have another way to listen to music besides your computer hunt down CDs ,1
who's your favorite artists do you like listening to rap music pop music,1
do you like spending time listening to music what about some of those other activities is anything else interest you that maybe there's something you've never tried before ,1
well it sounds like your mom is concerned and getting on your case about being on the computer all the time not spending time with your really is this sound about ,1
do you imagine she wants for you when she takes your computer way just imagine,1
so your mom wants you to do things other than planned right here and you think you already do other things besides playing on computer yet hmm well you've shared with me that your mommy com so if you decide yourself to come see me let's just imagine what would you like to do in this time with me here for the next  weeks how do you see us sharing your time together what would you like to do any sessions with me pet cats ,1
dead cats minutes we can pet cats do you have can I better have you written by elegance ,1
pit cast session pet cups it's all very great idea yes okay well thanks for taking a look at that sheet of activities um maybe you just hold on to that for next week and take a look at it and see if there's anything that interests you and maybe take it take a marker and circle it and we can take a look at exploring some different activities is that something the light interest you ,1
we'll have a good week and I'll see you next time you're so going to meet you,1
hi William I'm Heather I'm so glad to meet you ,1
hi Heather thanks for coming in sure how was your trip over ,1
but you know first time coming here you made it I made it right fantastic and it looks like you brought some paperwork with you  C 	and I didn't I filled out the form ,1
thank you for all of that how was all that for you it's a lot of papers a lot to fill out ,1
fantastic well thanks so much for going through all of that e note was a lot to ask and I'm so glad that you're here and that you made it and we can most certainly go through any of that that would be useful for you today okay and I'm wondering if maybe at first before we get started I'd like to check in with you and just see if there's any questions things that you've been thinking about or wondering about since you first heard about our program that might have brought you here might be on your mind ,1
sure so you're back with us again and thinking about gosh this time might be different for you and may be wondering what that might look like ,1
anything else that might be on your mind or even thinking about or wandering about?,1
so they're really wondering right now if if if work is possible for you,1
do you think it is well I hope that through our work together you'll be able to decide that for yourself hmm and my hope in our process is that that we could be partners and thinking about that together and what what work might look like for you in your life and how it might fit in for you how does that sound ,1
so thinking about for yourself what you know could be possible is almost a new thought for you right now ,1
honestly and something brought you here today it did ,1
what was it that made you decide even with all of that sort of thinking about at home?,1
and yet there was something that brought you here ,1
so there was a moment in time when you were sitting in your chair watching your oldies that you thought is this what the rest of my life will be like em hmm will there be something you know that be something more and also you know it's part of the time it's like yeah this is it you know you made your bed be happy with it and this is this is all there is in that's it then this other part is not too sure if that's okay ,1
well I'm really glad you're here William and I look forward to finding out much more about what it is that's most important to you and what you want your life to be like in it in the future and you do know what's best for yourself you have those voices that you said that tell you what you do like and what works for you and and the voice that sort of says I'm not sure that this is what's best for me you have a lot of things kind of rolling around in your ,1
I noticed that you got a little tense and sort of it's almost like those wheels are turning again just considering it as the coaches are tracking ,1
I guess and you have some hope for your future that things can be different for you I hope so I'm sure what that looks like yet don't know what it looks like ,1
so what do you think if the two of us together um could potentially start exploring that journey a little bit some of the things you mentioned just in our brief interaction right now have been that you that you have a son that lives with you that is really doing okay and so you're able to start thinking about yourself in your life and that maybe you're a little concerned about what the future might bring and what some of the things in your life that you're dealing with your criminal history for instance might potentially get in your way and how could you how could you get around that what life could you have for yourself at home it's more than sitting in that easy chair watching your oldies mhm so if we may be delved into a bit more of that sort of what you're thinking about working how does ,1
you're ready to at least explore it huh so um would this be a good time for me to share a little bit maybe about how our program might have changed from the last time ,1
so how I see things is that I sort of feel like maybe a guide or a partner with you in your journey towards work in thinking about work from where you are now maybe feeling a little bit confused or not sure about what the future may bring and then to bringing you forward to however that looks for you in your life and hopefully to that place where you really want to be where you're doing something that that fits for you and feels good and that we it as a program have some resources that we could potentially utilize together our first step would be of course today to take your application for services and then after that I would be able to look at whether or not you're eligible to work together on this journey and if so we would be able to figure that out together what that path looks like so how does that sound to you?,1
that's a great question so you really you really want to know what the path forward might look like yeah what to expect what to expect ,1
oh you and I together can potentially plan that mm-hmm we can talk about there are certainly certain time frames in our program around eligibility our first step is the application and then we have some time frames and together our hope is that we can even improve on those time frame um so I guess it's kind of a wait and see well know when it happens how long it takes absolutely but the first step is just to get started and how about if we along the way maybe kind of check in with each other around expectations and time frames would that be useful?,1
yeah yeah totally so if you'd like to get started would you mind if I take a look at your application paperwork and just make sure that there isn't anything that I may have a question about ,1
Well why don't you tell me a little bit about what brings you here today.,1
"Yeah. So you're, you've heard a little bit about the program here. Would it help if I just explained a little bit about what, what my role might be today",1
"Yeah. What I want to reassure you of is that i'm not here to try and tell you anything that you might need to do or to try and give you advice or any information at all. I'm here to help you in whatever way is useful to you. Just sorta sort out what's going on and what if anything you'd like to do differently. So, this is really up to you. What you would like to explore today. How does that sound?",1
"Yeah, so right now you're feeling a little overwhelmed with everything that's going on and you're not even sure where to start.",1
"Yeah. So now anything, any kind of decisions you make or anything that you do, effects both you and the, and the baby.",1
"Yeah. Well, if you're interested or you're willing, why don't you tell me a little bit about your story?",1
"So the, in the history of the relationship over this year, it's kind of been in and out in a way. And that there have been some incidents where you've had some arguments and separated for awhile and gotten back together.",1
It does sound like something pretty significant happened that sort of  Freaked everybody out.,1
"And all, all of you. The baby and you and him and, and was kinda scary.",1
"So in a way it doesn't, it didn't even really make sense to you or to him, because on the one hand he's really good, good with you, and good with the father, I mean good with your child, and on the other hand it was like what is this? Something really different.",1
"What, what are your thoughts right now about some of the options out there for you to do, if, if anything? What are, what are you thinking about?",1
"Mm-hm. So you had been kinda thinking about maybe going back to work and doing, doing some of that on your, on your own. And, and yet he, he doesn't really, he's expressing that he'd like to be able to take care of you and- ",1
"And when he's there he, he does take care of you?",1
"Yeah, because that leaves you in a real bind, when you're, you're there and you don't have what you need.",1
"Yeah. So you kind of find yourself when you're in that bind trying to find ways of, of getting, getting what you need met, and, yeah.",1
"I just wanna say we, we can go over some things that are potential to talk about to really focus on that might help you. But I just want to let you know that this is, I really appreciate, how hard this is to be able to talk about it and it's, it's not an easy situation and you're definitely not alone and I really appreciate your willingness to talk about it.",1
"Yeah. I know.  There are lots of different things that we can talk about that are, that, that many women in very similar situations find themselves. And things that we can talk about and focus our conversation on that might help you just sort of sort out and figure out what, if anything, that you want to do differently or how to, what your next step might be.",1
"And, and, some of those that we work with are like talking about the relationship. You've mentioned a few things about your, your relationship and how it kind of goes in and out and it's, can be really good and then he can be gone for a while, and just sort of sorting some of that out about where you are with that. We can certainly talk about resources, about the resources in the community that may be there for you or in terms of your own understanding, but also if you are in need of additional help we can talk about those.",1
"We can talk about safety planning, I mean one of the, one of the important things is to try and help you find a way to make sure that you feel good about keeping yourself and, and your baby safe  And we can talk about that. We can talk about finances. You mentioned you were thinking about going back to work but that you were relying on him right now.",1
"We can certainly explore that a little bit more. Taking care of yourself, which- ",1
"Yeah, yeah. For many, many new, new moms, that's hard under any circumstances, to find a way to take care of themselves and keep themselves healthy. So that's certainly something we can talk about. And also, just the whole issue about taking care of your child, and, and your, your mothering, your parenting. How you might, how you might, focus on that and, in this situation.",1
Or there might be something else that you feel is really important to deal with right up front just to start with.,1
"Mm-hm. So maybe y, y, you spend a lot of time already thinking about your relationship and really struggling with w, w, what it, where, what it means and where it is.",1
"And now you are kinda think well maybe I oughta think about some other things and see where I might go with those. These things, if, if, a job and taking, learning how to be a better mother and might be might help the relationship so that might be. So it might be a way of focusing on how, how you might be able to take care of yourself. Get, get a job or look at the possibility of doing that, and the same time trying to incorporate your, taking care of your child. Tho, those things might help you and might free you up to figure out then what to do about the relationship.  What to do about the relationship.",1
"Mm-hm. And, you know, you, you're the only one that, that really will know about that. About the dealing with the relationship. About what, when the timing is right for any decision that you make, one way or the other.",1
"Yeah. Well, and it sounds like you'd like to think about making some decisions in other areas and, and, when you think about. Was that, was that right? Would you like to focus a little bit on just the possibility of getting a job. Is that something you'd like to talk about?",1
"Well, you mentioned earlier that you had kind of been thinking about going back to work- ",1
"When, after the baby was born. What, what thoughts do you have about how you might go about balancing that and, and, and thinking about, thinking about that? What have you thought about?",1
"Yeah. So you might have to explore some other options for the child care and, and other ways of taking care of the, the baby so that you would be still okay about going back to work.",1
"To, yeah, to be out and working and paying somebody. That sounds like a lot.",1
"It really does sound, though, like you, you're really deeply committed to taking care of your child and providing the kind of structure and, and, and things, the basic needs, and really taking care of your child at the same time.",1
Being jealous and not wanting you to have friends.,1
"But it's, you've mentioned that a couple times now that it's, that it sort of surprises you. They way you're thinking about it and the way you're approaching it. Like, you, you're recognizing or seeing that you have spent a lot of time really agonizing over, over the relationship and, and why things are happening in the relationship, or what it really means. You've spent a lot of time there. That kinda surprises you that you might be thinking about it differently.",1
"So, you're realizing too, how much it really takes to focus attention on the baby and to be able to do it and it's like I, I, I it's hard to do both.",1
"Well, one of the things that we, we look at is trying to help people who are in, in a situation similar to you. Where, where there might be some, where there might be some fear about something that could, that might happen, or you know. And I know you said he, he, he had indicated that he wouldn't do it again. But sometimes it really helps people to feel, to have some plans in place for what you would do if anything came up and how to get you and your baby safe if that's what needs to happen. So if he kinda got that weird look in his eye again which, actually, I've seen before, but he just never really did anything like this before.",1
"Yeah, okay so like if I recognize, if I saw that look, what to do? Is that? ",1
"yeah and, and, and sometimes that ties in with, you know there might be places that you can go to, to get safe. There might be steps that you can take to, to really keep yourself safe. Or make sure that the baby's safe. Or people to call, or thing, just things that you can do based on what your life is like and what you, what resources you have available to you.",1
Is that something you're interested in really exploring?,1
Mm-hm. Some ways it just seems like it shouldn't have to be that way.,1
"Yeah. It really took you by surprise. It's something that you're just trying to figure out where. How does this fit and what, what does it mean?",1
"Yeah. Well, let me see if I, if I got it all, and then we can make some decisions about where to move from here or how to take the next step with that. And I wanna make sure I, I understand a little bit about your situation.",1
"And, this, first of all, this is the first time you've come in. This is the first time that you've had something that really happened, this incident that happened where he pushed you really, prompted you to, to take some steps. Because it's scared you.",1
"Mm-hm. You have this relationship that's been kinda off and on and but he's been very supportive and helpful in terms of giving you, meeting your basic needs and the baby's basic needs and wants to take care of you.",1
"And, and there are times when it's really good. And there are times when you've been less sure. And this is, this incident has also made you kind of think about that.",1
"Some of the ways that you've been thinking about or, or thinking about it now kind of surprises you. But you're looking at thinking about the possibility of maybe working it out to go back to work a little bit. So that you can have more financial independence, if you will, or be able to take care of yourself for those times when you need to.",1
And you're starting to toy with the idea of maybe it might be useful to have a really good plan to keep yourself safe. Did that kind of get it all?,1
"Yeah, yeah. So, maybe we can, we can take that next step and, and and. When, when, when we get together again and we can do that. We can just take the next step and start looking at some planning for both of those, in both of those areas.",1
"For keeping yourself safe. And, and for, you know, looking at the possibilities. Cuz there are options and resources out there should you choose to, to, to make the decision to go back to work.",1
"Yeah, there, there are other options for, for, for a variety of things and we can make some, have some discussions about that.",1
"Well, I, I really appreciate again your coming in today. And we will follow up with this conversation and in you, you will have,  ",1
wondering if you would be willing to share with me what you picked ,1
let's see do they seem to be in order when I tell you about them? or just however you'd like to start ,1
um wanting to start with family and it says to have a happy loving family ,1
it's a really a family that is kind of your rock and he family is very different than maybe the words that are on this card and yet family really called out to you family did you know that's basically the only people ,1
so family and responsibilities are tied together for you and responsibility is something that you haven't always been as you would like and yet you've grown in your ability to be responsible possibly partly because of your family ,1
so sometimes how they interact with you you don't always feel what you're trying to show them ,1
yeah and because of what you're thinking you sometimes then really try to act responsible and hope that they will be able to see what you're trying to show ,1
yeah so this is do these really fit together for you so tell me about the others that you pay,1
yeah so it gives you pride to be able to show something you are able to do even it's even if it's sometimes difficult ',1
you said I do you feel pride mm-hmm I do you know you dirty a dish you clean it and put it away that's that's what you do and if it's difficult and others notice ,1
so you mentioned that somehow that also connects with family it's not only for yourself it's also sometimes for others possibly being able to show them that you're responsible in your own dwelling in what you're able ,1
your boy true changes us when you start talking about the right that you have and what you're able to do with what you feel like might not be a lot ,1
so in thinking about family responsibilities and cleanliness there's that sense of pride of something bigger than yourself and you're really working hard here and yet you've got this this hammer that sort of fits in there with all of that no tell me more about how you see humor fitting in in your life with all of these things that seem to be so almost serious mmm really focused well and understand ,1
you've seen this game but it's some draw it's like words of friends but you draw pictures and you have the other person ,1
mm-hmm and it touches them in a way that you want to touch them ,1
so you really have a connection with your family through the actions that you take in your life to show them that you're a responsible person and these relationships with her family are really central to your life right now they are the people that you interact most with and you have pride in yourself so that respect of yourself and being able to show your family what you're really able to do in your life how you're able to keep things clean and presentable and have that sense of pride and yet it seems that your humor and creativity is something that really is almost a more powerful thing in being able to show who you are and getting special recognition for in your life who you are as a person and maybe a part of you that you have yet to fully discover or to show the world who you can be what do you think of all that feels pretty good,1
yeah hmm so haven't really thought of yourself in that way,1
William mm-hmm han couldn't couldn't keep it here this this is important to you this humor the humor yeah keeps me going that creativity yeah keeps me going it's almost like that that light ahead that hope that you were talking about ,1
I don't think some people realize how important humor and their life is and it's very very important to me clearly as you see the path ahead and thinking about work and I know you mentioned that when you were considering your values you were thinking about work at that time ,1
how if at all do you see possibly utilizing these core values family responsibilities cleanliness and humor in thinking about what your life could be like with work it work?,1
okay that's a really important a site to bring through the workplaces having a clean workspace or being like remembering that cleanliness is important in the workplace being a good work partner ,1
of course responsibility because if your employee there's always that expectation that you'll do what is asked of you or that you'll do what you say you'll do and you know you can do that right ,1
yeah so you really think about others and how they interact with you ,1
and who you are as a person that's those are all important things for you ,1
well thank you very much William for taking the time and really thinking about your core values and you mentioned this it was difficult to pick um and you shared a lot about about who you are and and sometimes it may be a little uncomfortable and thinking about those those things that are really most precious to us and I just really wanted to thank you for that opportunity to really get to know you about her and I hope that I hope it was useful for you and that we can use it together in our work figuring out what the path ahead might look like he'll work in your life how can I remember these what do you think when you when there are things that you want to remember in your life how does it work for you how do you typically remember things I think I need to write it down so i'll write it on a piece of paper ,1
yeah something that you can maybe take no doubt ,1
it's interesting to consider who it might be something as a reminder to yourself about what a really responsible person and that humor is also important to you,1
those things that are most important the guiding principles in your life ,1
I'm good things just wondering how you've been doing since you at the hospital ,1
so you're making some progress so in a group therapy improving with your depression but you're experiencing some symptoms from your asthma you do a bit more about that ,1
okay so you're getting some shortness of breath and fatigue really easily would it be okay with you if we talked a little bit about your smoking today ,1
okay I mean I totally understand that that's a difficult subject to talk about and it's completely up to you I just would like to talk about it with you because I do think and have some magnificent on your health today I'm worried about how it's affecting you in your day-to-day life would it be okay if we talk about your health issues and we can kind of slowly talk about it get into that will take a while we keep making a squeaker as long as you want this is your time and we're here for you ,1
ok so in your everyday life how else has being affected you other than the shortness of breath and the fatigue that you've been experiencing ,1
okay so that's a negative aspect of smoking for you is that you can't be around your niece and that your father has died from smoking so let's talk about maybe some of the positive things that smoking guys for you ,1
okay so now let's talk about the opposite side we're going to talk about the pros and cons of stopping smoking so what would be some of the negative things if you stop if you decide to stop smoking ,1
so your eyes one would get worse you can't be with your niece is often and you would be going along the same path as your dad which is ultimately death so let's talk about the positive things of stopping ,1
so after we kind of talked about the pros and cons ultimately you have a lot of pros to that you enjoy about smoking it's a social aspect and you enjoyed in a house with your depression but also there's the opposite side where you can't spend as much time with your niece as you want to expect your health it's expensive there seems to be a lot of negative things that you described um well how do you feel about that but there's kind of this discrepancy between the two ,1
so I think like that comes first but again I would just be really hard to stop them like you know in this habit well I definitely applaud you for considering it because I know it wasn't something that you claim to come here to talk about and this was on your schedule but it's definitely important to your health and I'm just like to ask you on a scale of  to  with  being not ready to change at all intending but you're ready to change right now right this second where would you lie on that spectrum ,1
so six is a great start and I definitely think that that's something that we can work with together on do you know of any thing that will help you quit smoking? ,1
yeah so exercising did different group of friends that maybe isn't it revolved around smoking with that there's also group therapy that I know you do for your depression which is also awesome to help people stop smoking and we can give you some pamphlets and give you a number that we can set you up with have you ever considered nicotine patches ,1
okay so let's get you the number and we can discuss the nicotine patches are an alternative for you that would work we can schedule an appointment or in the next two or three weeks and see the progress that you've made and I really am glad that we had this conversation and it seems like you're readily ready to quit so that's awesome ,1
you leap in so far I'm still a little bit anxious ,1
yes last week when you were and you were telling me that you were experiencing great anxiety and we had developed a plan a plan for your anxiety and according to my notes you were going to look into some yoga classes you were going to attempt to drink less coffee you were going to get out more with people because you were kind of isolating yourself in the home and you were going to spend more time in nature so I'm wondering how all that went ,1
okay so it sounds like you've made some movement forward towards your goals you did at least look into yoga even though the gym didn't have yoga classes you did cut down from two cups of coffee to one and you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk but it sounds like you had a little bit of an issue getting out more with people ,1
so it's uncomfortable for you to be out around people with all the speaking and chatting and talking and how does that make feel ,1
okay so actually getting out with people actually makes you even more anxious so I'm wondering what we could do about that ,1
that would absolutely be one option you could invite people over to your house and then you could get to choose who you're around ,1
and in terms of the the yoga let's get back to the yoga format tell me more about where you looked for yoga classes ,1
mm-hmm and so if I were to ask you right now how motivated are you to find a yoga class on a scale of one to ten ,1
okay and so what made you say five or six rather than two or three,1
so when you see the pictures on your newsfeed it makes you excited about doing it but when you actually go to do it it makes it yeah more challenging,1
mm-hmm and so you're thinking that you're not as flexible as the other people I'm wondering if that's what yoga is about civility ,1
mm-hmm so you are concerned that maybe you might not be as flexible as the rest yeah and you'd be a beginner,1
okay so what do you think would happen if you couldn't do the poses in class,1
okay so you'd be embarrassed if you couldn't do the certain poses and how would you feel if you could do all the poses in the class,1
and so what do you think it is preventing you from not doing all the poses in the class ,1
what what would cause you to not be able to do it with the closest or not,1
okay I remember when you first came in last week you told me that when you were younger you used to be very very flexible and I'm wondering what would make that difference between then and now,1
and how would it be if you couldn't do all the poses in the class and you did get embarrassed and you just let it be embarrassed ,1
do you think if you put up with a little bit of embarrassment ,1
you know I can give you a lots of studies that I can give you and videos that I can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga and their anxiety went way down as a matter of fact some studies show that anxiety doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications so I'm not sure if you were if you knew that or not ,1
okay so how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to ten,1
good good that's a definite improvement and and you could determine after that first class whether you're levels have decreased or not and that would that be validation for you or would that be you give you even more motivation if your anxiety levels were decreased instantly after the yoga class,1
okay to continue so one other thing that I wanted to to mention to you um was you said that you'd walk your dog in nature and I'm curious as to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature ,1
mmm-hmm and so because of it was cold and Wendy you decided to kind of cut the walk short ,1
and and that's definitely understandable I'm wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking the dog in a day ,1
and do you have a special place in nature that makes you feel peaceful that you could be and that would help you even more enjoy it ,1
okay excellent it's great that you have trails around your house where you're not exposed to all that noise and so do you think you could commit to an hour probably and on a scale of one to ten tell me what that probably means ,1
okay all right so it sounds like last week you had a few problems carrying out play assignments towards decreasing your anxiety you really couldn't find a yoga class because you're already signed up for a gym that doesn't have the yoga classes but you you already know about the yoga videos that I've sent you so you could actually do them at home how strongly do you feel about doing them at home,1
mm-hmm I think that would be a big difference and then there would be no embarrassment factor if you couldn't do the poses less coffee you've gone from two cups to one cup that's very good and get out more with people you've decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people not knowing who's going to be in your space that's always an apprehensive moment when you don't know you have no control over who's going to be in your space and on a scale of one to ten you think that you could spend at least an hour a day walking with the dog job I think we have a plan so overall on all four of these items how motivated do you feel on a scale of one to ten ,1
fabulous and how do you think you will feel if you were to envision how you would feel incorporating all of these items in your life next week of the course of next week how much of a difference do you think it would make you feel,1
and so you feel relaxed and you would feel more positive and I think you would - very good ,1
we'll check in next week we'll make an appointment for next week and catch up and see how you're doing with all this good job ,1
good afternoon Bruce I'm glad you could make it in today thanks for coming in here last week when you were an you had come in because you had had a positive urine analysis test for marijuana and so we were working on ways that you could cut down or extinguish marijuana use all together and how did you feel about our talk last week ,1
yeah just okay yeah all right okay I want to refresh your memory at not godly notes here do you mind if I refer to my notes,1
oh we had developed for strategies to help you decrease the amount of marijuana if not cut it off altogether and one of the items were worlds were to run more you used to run a lot and you like to run and so we have realized that the marijuana use usage was merely a mask to self-medicate for the depression but we also know that running up serotonin and in many cases is just as good as an antidepressant so you're excited about this last week so I'm wondering how you made up with the running last week ,1
so yeah yeah and so because of the rain and the coldness it kind of took away from your from your mood and your motivation to go running,1
I'm wondering what you could have done to get in the mood,1
did it make any difference in your marijuana usage this week ,1
okay okay so how would you tie those two things together by not running,1
yeah yeah so when you reflect back now on last week and the rain coming down and it was cold I'm wondering if there's a way that you could change your perception about that such that it wouldn't stop you from running how do you think ,1
mm-hmm that would be a great idea that would be an excellent idea some people even think that it's fun running in the rain and the cold so that might that might absolutely be an alternative the other thing was to stay away from your friends that you would consider bad influences with using the marijuana how did you make out with that,1
so it was it was difficult to cut them out of your life last week and can you tell me more but what was difficult about it ,1
so you didn't it sounds like you didn't want to hurt their feelings three by them thinking that you were going to avoid them ,1
and so because you were worried about them thinking that you were trying to avoid them you ended up using marijuana is that correct ,1
yeah and I'm wondering how you could do that differently this week ,1
yeah sometimes it is that simple is just making that commitment to yourself and just drawing the line and do you have any friends that do not use marijuana that you could kind of associate with ,1
okay how motivated on a scale one to ten would you say you are too kind of reignite friendships with people with people that don't smoke pot ,1
okay so you're still you're still a little iffy about you what about whether you want to associate with those friends again but I have to ask you Bruce what gee what made you say three instead of one ,1
that's great insight that you're able to see that moving towards the friends that don't smoke pot and making the effort to do that is actually going to enhance your life incredibly and when you associated with the friends that didn't smoke pot in the past what kind of things did you do what was your life like ,1
that would say so you can recall living up healthier life than and having fun of doors and basically having the healthier life overall without using the pot ,1
mm-hmm sometimes it's good to remember having those good times with the friends that didn't smoke the part because it makes you realize that you don't really need it and I think it's a great I think that's a great idea the other item on your goal whether it's a goal not an item was to get a pet how did you make out go and it was a dog you were going after a dog at the SPCA and how did you make out with that why was ,1
mm-hmm okay so you had some second thoughts about that you are excited about it in last week's session but after a chance to reflect upon it you kind of realize that it wasn't getting a dog was not the best thing for you ,1
I'm wondering if there is another option that you might consider,1
yeah there's all kinds of animals and snakes or fish or something okay snakes are fish that would definitely be a star these animals that you like ,1
all right yeah I think it's important that you have an animal that you like and that you can relate to alright so in the final goal was to find and join a support group for people that were trying to be asked and then from marijuana how did you make out with that ,1
so you made the effort to go and you went but that was ,1
and so we you didn't say the whole time and so you left early because you felt you didn't feel in you they were the bottom of the barrel and you're still higher functioning,1
I can definitely understand that I'm wondering if there is any purpose for you joining some sort of support group to help you what do you think,1
mm-hmm and what might be some positives that you would get out of the support group,1
so you're you're saying that the positives of being in a support group would be that you'd get a chance to relate to other people who are on that same journey and do have connections with other people and again I can send you information that will show you that that just these two items alone are incredibly helpful for not only decreasing or being abstinent from pod but from increasing the feel-good hormones in your body the connection and the relating to other people it might be similar when you are younger you had mentioned last week that you were a hockey player and so you had support that was sort of like a the team was sort of like a support group I'm wondering if you could relate to people and had connections so I'm wondering if you could see a support group as a team,1
mm-hmm and and do you remember when you were playing hockey how it felt to be encompassed in that team it's good it gave and that's because of those good feeling hormones that come and neurotransmitters that come throughout your body when you have those connections so how committed do you think you are if I were to send you a list of support group so you could try out some others where there weren't the bottom of the barrel as you say there how committed do you think that you would be trying out at least two of them this coming week ,1
yeah wow what made you see an eighth rather than a  ,1
so you thought of how you remembered you remember how you felt when you were on the team and how it gave you that sense of connection ,1
I love that analogy good thinking good thinking Bruce that's excellent Wow well just to summarize today you came then you had made some progress that you had some stumbling blocks um you have decided that whether it's rain or shine you're going to run anyway because you're going to have you raincoat and you're going to embrace more of your positive friends rather than the friends that are not such a good influence on you and getting a pet rather than getting a dog you're going to look into getting a snake or what was the other thing ovation okay and in terms of a support group I will send you a list of support groups and you feel that on a scale of one to ten that you're about an eight and actually caring through and drying up two of these support groups because of the hockey team analogy great job so overall how would you rate today's session ,1
and if we were to put it on a scale again one to ten for debate ,1
we did good that if we didn't eight glad you came in to Dave Bruce and I will see you next week and check up and we will we will see how you did with these goals and then we will move forward from there all right way to go ,1
William it's really nice to see you back again ,1
um in before we get started on the specifics of this I'm wondering if there's anything that you're concerned about today or things that you've been thinking about in relationship to that?,1
yeah so that you've been thinking about it a lot and about some of the issues that may come up and actually I what I what I put together here is in looking at your paperwork I kind of pulled out some of the things that are possible for us to talk about and I you had indicated on there that you had medical marijuana so I've got that I walk the whole issue with the pain okay on there it does sound like the that thinking about dealing with your son might be an important one for us to consider in this too ,1
yeah you know you mentioned in your in the paperwork that what you you wanted some help sort of thinking through a work goal or the possibility of work at all ,1
and you mentioned last time about the criminal history that you had a little bit of concern about the misdemeanors were there that were there you also have talked about in your that you were on the SSDI and that you had you know for your for the injury based on your injury and the disability and sort of thinking about maybe some benefits thinking about that in relationship to work and has another thing we could discuss so another thing that was on there was the education and you mentioned about the not having a GED or finishing up high school and that's certainly something we can talk about and how that might affect work you mentioned the that there had been some issues with alcohol addiction and certainly that is a topic that we could talk about and how that might you know might play in with the work and then the pain management and the sort of follow-up to the injury and what what that is what that is or what concerns you have about that and as you just mentioned you the issue with your son and how what your role in taking care of him or how much that puts on the family stress mhm and all of those are areas that we could start with and I'm also wondering if there's something that you feel is more important to start with in terms of initiating this journey towards figuring out what your goal is ,1
so that's certainly possibly the exploration of what kinds of work that aren't that aren't physical in nature recognizing that you wouldn't be able to do the kind of work that you did previously bright and really thinking about that and certainly there's some resources that we have for helping in that exploration and looking at there are a lot there are other options out there are ya okay for someone my age you think?,1
and so it's already it's pretty obvious and it also sounds like that pain is really taken up a pretty big role in your in your life and it feels like a pretty big barrier right there,1
well how about we spend some time really talking about what what that pain management might look like what what you've been doing and and sort of how you see that playing out in your work that be that's not okay?,1
tell me you mentioned the marijuana and you mentioned that you um that you know that you have a cane and have some adaptations and tell me what else you're sort of doing to manage the pain right now ,1
I want to affirm how much you know about yourself that you made decisions about how manage this based on not wanting to get yourself in trouble with addiction again?,1
yeah yeah so that stays at the kind of the forefront to the top of your head to like oh boy and if the stress gets too much that could be a problem ,1
it's true yeah you know one thing it sounds like the pain management is probably the place where might be useful to start because that might be the most the right up front the thing place to start so we can do that and we can talk about there are alternatives out there and and different programs and different situations that have been useful for others in your situation in terms of managing pain so maybe we will send me to a shrink maybe they'll shrink that ankle ,1
and so it sounds like you've had some experience that ,1
yeah because you really know you know what it is and you've been living with it and working with it and trying to find a way to manage it for a long time ,1
well I can assure well that that we that we can find alternatives to that,1
yeah okay well how about we go ahead and set that up and we'll start there and we'll keep these others and what I want to let you know is that if other things come up that we need to cover we can put them on this list to to make sure we'll check in about these okay it's time we meet and figure out what if you know where what we want to work on that day okay start with the pain ,1
hello my name is Tenzing I'm a certain nurse from Humber what is your name,1
I see um before we talk about that I want you know that whatever we talk about today is going to be kept confidential ,1
so let's talk more about what brought you in today ,1
i have type  diabetes and i know i need to exercise to help man to my diabetes but i just cannot make time for it i wish i can find ways to manage my time ,1
mm-hmm so you wish to make time to exercise so you can manage your diabetes ,1
um what are the benefits of not exercising to you ,1
okay so what are the costs maybe of finding time to exercise ,1
so let me see if I understand this correctly so you recognize that exercising is important to control your diabetes and to prevent yourself from taking medications to prevent diabetes um so you also mentioned that to exercise you have to cut down on your family time which is also valuable to you exactly okay son how long will just say from now would you think that you know you take make this change let's say probably within a monk okay so and how on a scale of zero to ten like how important is it for you to make this change and zero being not not not important at all and  being the most important ,1
because like I said it is really important for me to manage time to exercise so that my diabetes can be managed and controlled ,1
and on the same scale of zero to ten how confident are you in being able to make the change,1
okay and so would I be correct in saying that it's very important to you so it's nine out of ten to make time to exercise to stay healthy and mainly to avoid having to take medication to manage your diabetes and your confidence level is at eight out of ten and being able to make this change ,1
okay so looking back is there a reason that you haven't been able to make time talk to sighs ,1
okay so how would you like for things to change,1
I see so what kind of things did you do to control your diabetes in the past ,1
that's good can you probably give me an example like the activities you did and when was the last time ,1
mm-hmm and what makes you feel that now it was a good time to try something different ,1
mm-hmm so we should like to discuss some of the things you can do to make time to exercise ,1
well those are some great alternatives instead of going to gym you save a lot of time so did you we want to know did you want to know more things or ways to find time to exercise ,1
okay so since you mentioned that spending time with your family was something that you really value ah you could probably and watching software he said you could you know put a treadmill like a exercise machine near your TV Here I am so you can exercise and watch your movie or software with your family and what you can also probably plan outdoor events or outings with your family something that your kids would enjoy so that they can be off their iPads and technology ,1
those are something you can do maybe go jogging with your family ,1
mm-hmm so now that we have had this conversation um how do you feel about you know making time now to exercise ,1
and would you like you know other maybe more sessions to follow up,1
sure and when would you like that for probably ,1
okay sure see you next what then and I really appreciate you showing up today and making an effort to come here to discuss your condition and you know what making time to exercise for your diabetes,1
in frustrating because you have no control of the house ,1
so you wish you had that pants and power where you can be able to get your son to do the things that you and your husband would like for him to do ,1
sounds like you've given up on yourself to be able to use those parenting things to try to get him to be able to listen to your house he's gotten physical ,1
and you tell me something well one thing I am here is that you guys are working really hard to try to get your family back on track and get your son back to the place where you guys can have that a better family family environment ,1
one good thing is you're willing to trust them to something you really try some new things because you're open to that you've tried and you kind of said you gave up a little bit but what you just said that I heard was that you are willing to maybe pick up and try some new things that might be helpful ,1
well the good thing is we know  things that don't work so we don't have to do those things over again okay so if you had to rate it on a scale of one to ten how how important is it for you to try to strengthen your parenting skills with your husband?,1
about you want right something's going through this for a really long time and just feeling like you're the point where you want to be loved but you did say a five and you know that does leave room for hope so why wouldn't you say a two or one like your husband?,1
so you are very hopeful for your family and for your son just would you be willing to continue to work with me to to learn some of those things maybe I can be helpful for you to try to find some things that might fit for your family ,1
we got to get him in here and see if we can get you to on the same page but at least you're willing to say that you're willing to try ,1
wow so you would be willing to come back in here next week and be able to sit with me and they kind of go from there new ways to work with your family and not try those always over again ,1
that's good to hear is okay if we just go over a couple of your details,1
okay so from the forms that you've filled in earlier today we found out that you're a  year old female you have bad knees and have been recently diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis you have recently sustained a tear to your right shoulder culturally you're from a Fijian Indian background you work part-time and have lived in Australia for  years you mentioned earlier that you also assault Carol for you to disable children is that correct ,1
I appreciate how difficult it must be for you to look after your children by yourself now tell me what brings you here today ,1
you said that your doctor mentioned that you should come here today that perhaps maybe I can help you some of these issues if you were to change or improve any area of your life where would it be ,1
well it must be difficult feeling that way and uncomfortable hopefully I can help you with this how important is it for you to change your life right now on a scale of  to  ,1
that's good to hear that your friends are looking after you how confident are you being able to make a change in your life honestly ,1
but you did say that you could lose weight how did it make you feel at the time ,1
so it sounds like that when you lost weight you felt better that's great and why do you think exercise may not have worked or being so effective for you ,1
I'm sure you could do it by yourself but a little assistance and some knowledge never hurts what do you think changed that made you potentially put the weight back on,1
okay it's important for you to recognize that amount of bread that you're eating probably wouldn't have helped and also the fact that you stop walking on the treadmill would lower your capacity to burn that food which an along one would affect your rheumatoid arthritis now that you say it ,1
from what I can gather your main issues preventing you from exercise include time and family obligations basically,1
you can see in order to lose weight and improve on your symptoms diet modifications and some sort of exercise need to be implemented into your daily routine yes that make sense,1
of course it would but you'll need to be committed to your own personal improvements look at how committed you are although it is hard work looking after your family that's true I see your point what do you think it would take to change your mind about participating in physical activity ,1
okay so if you were given a program that was realistic with time and easy completed at home do you think you could do this,1
so it seems as though you have put a lot of thought into your overall goals what if i say to you come back and see me in two weeks do you think in that time you would at least attempt to start the program provided ,1
on a scale of one to ten how confident are you that you'll be successful,1
hopefully we can get you to  by the end of it hopefully so I can see you're willing to make an effort let's say we meet here in two weeks then hopefully it's hopefully you have some competing exercise of sessions and progress to show me I try my hardest that's all I ask for i'm looking forward to helping you through this journey Jane it was nice to meet you ,1
so Rose thank you for coming in today can you just start off I tell me a little bit about yourself,1
well it sounds like you're really really happy about your life I can tell with your facial expressions and things like that you seem pretty content to be taking a little bit of time off from school right now and you know that you live with your parents sounds like you really enjoy spending time based off what you're what you're telling me ,1
so it seems like you're kind of conflicted about what's going on you know I'm hear you say that you got sick and it wasn't really big deal but it seems like your parents may have been your opinion overreacted ,1
kind of pulling out of school was causing you fall behind what you would like to be ,1
can you tell me a little bit more about what you mean by sick what kind of symptoms and you have what did that lead to ,1
so it sounds like you're really confused about why your symptoms even began ,1
I know that you really discuss that working out was it really important part of your life it's safe it can you tell me a little bit more about that?,1
well def don't want to be hearing that is this this is probably one of the biggest parts of your life and you know what you're saying and I don't even frustrated but you've been unable to do this inject home ,1
because of the illness and your parents concerns you know you express that you really like to work out every single day how many hours a day on average would you say that you work out?,1
so well it seems to give a lot going on with your life I mean taking that amount of time during a day to run I know it would be very exhausting so I can completely understand that getting the cold may seem pretty doable to you I know that you were referred here by your primary care physician dr. hafer and I know that your parents were just really concerned with not only the amount of exercise that you were doing that maybe also some of your other eating habits yo Mike us try to talk about tonight you can't be a little bit why you think that they're concerned about that at all?,1
how much fruit you have how much about how many vegetables you have how many you know how much mean you have?,1
I'm hear you say is that you're really you're following with the magazines and what the internet what all the other fitness experts are saying right it seems like your parent ships aren't fully understanding that that's just the regimen in the lifestyle that that industry village drives for and they don't follow themselves so ,1
you're doing fine you can continue on as you were we can sort of his head in the direction of I know you really discussed a lot about fitness and working out as one of your really important aspects of your life will you have some of the other important aspects of your life?,1
well it sounds like you are incredibly busy as a college student John sleeping ,1
it's something that I think would be very beneficial for the next week before we meet again it's I would like for you to try to do your best to journal kind of document maybe how your day goes you know in the morning what are you doing in the in the afternoon what are you doing it at night time where you're doing just just breathe little notations you know seven o'clock i'm doing this eight o'clock i'm doing this not every single hour but as often as you can remember I'm and I'm likely to bring that in next week for us to discuss that way we can kind of see how your schedule is going around real quick ,1
that sounds like we're going to do for training sometimes ,1
all right well I'll see you next weekend are good next thing  ,1
Jeffrey tell me what you'd like to talk about today? um press all you can call me Jeff the time ,1
okay so right now what you have so much going on that you're just feeling totally overwhelmed you don't even know where to start yeah thinking about trying to control your diabetes just seems like one more ,1
so it sounds like you mentioned that you had been going to church and then you also said that your wife and kids you're not with them right now so sounds like the people that you had in your life that men were a source of supporter there aren't there for you ,1
so that group is really helpful to you not only just to kind of chill out and have a good time but also you actually had some exercise ,1
okay so that was a really helpful thing for you in managing your diabetes and you're feeling a little bit lost not having that ,1
it sounds a little bit like you're feeling a change that you can't fulfill this role that you it's not so much ashamed,1
really you know you're really frustrated because they fell anything's going on in your life that you feel like you don't even have control,1
so in the past we were able to have the structure and also the support of people around you it's sort of added more daily basis it was easier for you there's a lot easier,1
okay so even though you're really overwhelmed right now and everything just sort out of control and you're feeling really really hope it sounds like you may have identified a few things to think about in trying to figure out where to move forward all right did work in the past right now  ,1
mmm unfortunately for me I hear that a lot so we're going to be talking about ways to manage your blood clots and options for treatment but first I'd like to check in on a few things the first is your smoking you were at a half pack at during your last visit and we talked about how important it is for you to quit I'd say it's even more important now that smoking is associated with Davey T so have you quit ,1
so do you remember our conversation from our last visit that's when I give you the information about quitting smoking and the contact number for tobacco treatment specialist ,1
well we're on the same page then because that's exactly why I'm talking to you about quitting smoking because smoking is a major risk factor for DVT even if you even if we treat you now if you don't quit smoking I'm afraid the blood clots will return again,1
unfortunately for me I hear that a lot so we're going to talk today about how to manage your blood clots and some options for treating but first I wanted to check in on your smoking status in our last visit I recommended that you begin to think about quitting and I would be interested in hearing your thoughts ,1
so when it comes to smoking you feel that other people want to tell you what to do and make your decisions for you you you don't feel heard or respected no respect that's it ,1
well I just want to say that I am very glad you decided to come in today so we can take care of this blood clot because blood clots are very serious and I know you're concerned as your provider I have to be honest and say that smoking can cause blood clots but hopefully some of the information I give you today will help you in your decision to quit smoking,1
having said that I know my opinion is not the deciding factor quitting smoking as a decision only you can make ,1
I know that would it be okay with you if I share some information about smoking and blood clots and I can tell you what I know and then we'll see what you think,1
can be you seem surprised and a little more aware now the smoking risks I guess so yes so Maria I'd like to get a better sense of what you think about smoking so on a scale of one to ten with one being you don't think it is at all important that you quit and ten being you're ready to quit today where would you put yourself ,1
but now i would have to say for why a four and not a lower number ,1
so having a better understanding of how smoking adds to the risk of blood clots increases your desire to quit or little ,1
what else if anything makes quitting important to you ,1
the possibility of losing your apartment because of smoking really upsets you in addition to your health ,1
so it sounds like your priority in life is taking care of providing for your children it's obvious that you're a good mom and if you had to leave your home because you were smoking that would be tough to bear ,1
so let me ask you a slightly different question on that same scale of one to  how would you rate your confidence to quit ,1
so you've been persistent in trying and haven't been successful yet still you you said a two and not a one I'm curious about that ,1
it sounds like you really feel like you let yourself and your children down and that's hard to accept given how much you love your kids ,1
so what what do you think sante and thao think about your smoking ,1
so you know it would be best for you and your children if you quit if you had the right support and tools to manage this addiction if you believed you could do it you would ,1
you quit for two months when you were pregnant with Te'o how did you do it then ,1
wow so you were able to quit on your own for two months that's impressive have you ever used any other form of help like nicotine replacement or support groups ,1
ah wow you must be pretty hard on yourself what would you say if I told you that very few people only four percent of us are able to quit successfully cold turkey no really is that true hmm yes and and most people try many times before their successful their medications and groups yet and I'd be happy to share that information with you I'd like to help you if that's something that you'd like,1
that's great maria you can look them over and i'll have our tobacco treatment specialist sonya follow up with you we have an excellent tobacco treatment program here and I am I believe that Sonya can help you quit when you're ready okay what one would be a good time to check back in she can call me next week and I'll let you know I may be ready to try again absolutely and I'll have Sonya call you I just want you to know that I understand how hard it is for you to talk about quitting smoking and I really appreciate it so would you like to talk about how to manage a blood clots ,1
okay nice to meet you Rachel cause your day going ,1
okay before we go any further isolation Oh yuck about their genius with with  minutes together today I have a couple topics I'd like to discuss but before going where it is there anything you'd like to you,1
okay so we will be done is there anything like today ,1
I completely understand your you have a busy lifestyle how are you going to fit exercise into that lifestyle ,1
so can you tell me about your day from when you wake up to ,1
why do you think your doctor would like to add to your heavy or your busy workload ,1
okay I hear you so on one hand you've gone all your life all day  you've gone  years and you're still you leave you're healthy and you don't think you need to add exercise or anything else like that but on the other hand to your doctor is telling you that exercise would help your diabetes and exercise will help you so what do you feel are some of the advantages of God working out are not adding exercise to hear ,1
it's good to see that you really enjoy spending time with your family and spending time with your kids do you can you tell me about some of the important things in your life,1
that's really good to hear so your would be seriously you're proud of it proud of you too can and you enjoy spending a lot of time here of course yeah and you'd you cherish the time you get to spend with your weakest and me because you made it so get them to fit into your already hectic lifestyle yeah advantage of these people exercise,1
I think you'll be a good stress reliever when I run of the track down and also maybe I can include the heart center you can spend some time at the gym together and all the weekend,1
so it's my understanding that you feel like exercising with other than we needed extra help by reducing or eliminating your insulin insulin dosage it could help you lose weight after the stress reliever you can come out really take care I've been in your children we have attended at it but you're still worried that he was really diving not how to continue on today after telling some strategy diseases including your ,1
so you would change the time you go to drinks or the lines which one you want to go ,1
and from what you're saying earlier you want to include your family and your husband or their bed we were straight the new year it support system comes with him any company any reason trying to see like ,1
so it looks to me like something and you're motivated scream and they will help you along your certain tone actual target any feel like if they're there with you then to improve monopoly entire thing and I'll just after the succession beauty like you have a plan ,1
scale of one to ten one being you're not really sure at all ending returning to do with how how come are you in  different as you don't go to you mate ,1
that way I concede little not your life better  ,1
so it sounds like you really want to go to Black Friday with your friends you're feeling a little anxious about it,1
that sounds like a great idea can absolutely do that,1
so we have some materials on the table but if you'd like to use anything else that we've used previously just let me know and I'll get them to you for you,1
all right is there anything you'd like to tell me about it,1
so it sounds like nature and mountains are coming to you do you think that this will be helpful I'm black Franny,1
hi George my name is Kaylee I'll be your nurse today I just want to let you know that everything we talk about here is confidential however I do have to let someone know if you're at risk of harming yourself someone else or this child abuse going on is that okay with you,1
okay so George doing a little bit about why you came into the clinic today,1
okay would you mind if we explore this issue a little further,1
okay so why don't we start by having you tell me a bit about your day and what seems to be getting in the way of you exercising right now,1
okay so it feels like you're having trouble fitting exercise into your schedule and you're starting to feel pretty discouraged and frustrated,1
okay so how important would you say this change is for you to make in your life we'll try on a scale from zero which is not important at all to time which is very important to me,1
okay pretty important yes and how confident would you say you are right in this moment that you'd be able to make this change and we'll do the same zero to ten scale,1
okay so hopefully we can get that confidence up a bit and from what I hear you saying it sounds like you have been successful in the past making these changes related to lifestyle and incorporating exercise into your schedule is another really big change that might be really difficult for you to make,1
well you know what I'm glad you did come in today it shows you're in a serious about your health and you really want to manage your diabetes better I'm sure was really hard to come in especially since you're not sure you if you really want to make this change right now,1
okay so it sounds like you know what can happen if you don't incorporate exercise so you know the risks and at the same time life is life is getting in the way,1
mm-hmm okay so from what I hear you saying you're having difficulty incorporating exercise into your schedule and at the same time you know the importance of exercise and the risks associated with not exercising and being a diabetic is that correct,1
okay but you mind if I provided you with a little bit more information about the benefits of exercise,1
okay good so for a diabetic an exercise can help lower your blood glucose which is very important you can also help lower your blood pressure and the great thing is that regular exercise can also help improve your energy improve your sleep and strengthen your bones and muscles which one of these benefits do you think you would appreciate the most,1
okay so it sounds like you're willing to make a change and you're getting kind of excited about possibly having more energy,1
okay so can you think of any ways you might be able to incorporate exercise interest go to area,1
okay that sounds like an excellent plan how many times do you think you could walk them to school this week I assume they go to school every day,1
okay George that would be great that sounds like a really good plan do you think there might be anything that could get in the way of this plan this week,1
okay so great so the plan is to walk your kids to school every day this week and maybe you can keep track of this on a piece of paper just maybe take off every day of the week that you've done your exercise for the day this way you can keep track of things visually and you know you can watch your progress okay so if you have any problems during the week please feel free to call the clinic and ask for myself or another nurse although this is your decision ultimately we are going to support you along the way I don't want you to ever feel like you're lowering this and we will we'll play to meet in one week to see how things are going and hopefully we can follow up after that and get that confidence level up,1
thanks so much for coming in today I really commend you for taking that first step towards change thank you George,1
so I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here so I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself basically my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in and thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life if you decide that you do it's not my job to change you I couldn't even if I wanted to that's not my role at all it's really to help you think about you know how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward that sound okay all right so why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself,1
very cool I've always wanted to be good at music all right so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun,1
it's kind of everyday sort of thing okay tell me a little bit about your family,1
very fun all right and how are things going in school for you,1
okay great so you're doing well what sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school,1
it's great that's really exciting to think about that and he's going to be looking forward to the future and those things all right well one thing I'm going to ask you about is um you know different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life whether it's you know their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies things like that so here's a little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community again cultural identity or family friendship modesty religion respect self-determination and spirituality so when you think about yourself which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life,1
okay can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three,1
okay great so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging like you said a sense of purpose anyway and then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing it's not just Authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you okay that's great all right well one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends,1
mm-hmm and when you're hanging out with friends is there ever alcohol involved,1
okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene,1
mm-hmm and so when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking,1
mm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink,1
so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohols get,1
okay and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus and that you're playing board games,1
okay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol,1
okay so sort of in the the too much drinking or our times can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol,1
hmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some some things happening,1
yeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened,1
huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol,1
so you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean busy,1
got it okay all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions,1
okay yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect too so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then,1
right and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that,1
okay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but about crossover okay and what have you come up with it at this point do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or,1
mm-hmm and do you feel like that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think,1
so a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like,1
like to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself,1
like I you know it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so you know I'm not damaging my body and I like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22,1
uh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important antennas it's the most important thing right now,1
uh-huh well why did you say six or seven rather than like a four,1
yeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for years now okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to,1
okay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that,1
so sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or,1
okay um so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going,1
does that sound like something you'd like to do okay well I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school and you know becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there and it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol and that you know there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health you school performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much so yeah you know it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again and be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going,1
alright great so I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks,1
great hello my name is Sara I'm the student pharmacist at what's a name and how can I help you,1
all right when a scale one to ten how bad is your headache,1
so what makes it better and what makes it worse,1
dude they do again those migraines select orphan,1
okay so before I recommend that medications to be and before I will I want you to ask you about your past medical history,1
do you take any medications or do you have any medical conditions,1
okay so I will recommend medication this one it's called excedrin extra strength it has if the one tablet contains three different medications inside first one is acetaminophen it's a pain reliever and the second one is aspirin it's a pain reliever and it's also anti-inflammatory drug hours and also it contains caffeine,1
and caffeine scanners constrict your blood vessels in your brain and also can relieve pain from from the migraine,1
all right so this medication because of your your headache is very bad I would recommend you to take two terabytes,1
by mouth every six hours but not more than eight tablets a day I say and you should not be taking this medication for more than 72 hours not more than three days and if you still feel the symptoms they're handing now after three days you should consult your doctor,1
and the best way to take this medication is with water,1
with a full glass of water and if you feel upset stomach you should take it with meals,1
usually this medication does not cause any major side effects however it make was obsessed Omikron or vomiting and you may feel a little bit nervous of shaking,1
because of caffeine all right and then I would advise you not to drink any alcohol tourist medication because it may increase your risk for a stomach bleeding or a liver disease all right and you should not be taking any other medications over-the-counter like Tylenol or ibuprofen advil that personally don't take any of this because it already contains no aspirin okay because it contains a renter those products so you should not be taking too much of it and I would also advise you not to have too much coffee or caffeine in general,1
all right because this product contains caffeine inside,1
all right and also this medication does not have any drug interactions with your metformin so don't worry affect that's what I am concerned okay and you know so how so do we have any questions for me,1
oh yeah oh you're welcome so you need any more help any questions you can always find me here,1
so Jane it sounds like you're angry with your supervisor would what would I be right in saying that,1
all right look maybe to help me understand you know more about that anger I'm wondering if you could you know choose two or three pictures here that look like how you were angry at the time which which of the cards here that would show how angry you were okay don't I might just take a look at those okay it does look like anger doesn't it it's a pretty big anger so after you'd had that you know a big thing with your mum you you went to your room right,1
thank you for sharing that with me because it really and being for being so honest about your anger because what it does is help I don't know if it's helping you but it's certainly helping me to understand that this is really big for you and it's a big expression but surprisingly you know anger anger's a good thing in a way because it's it's letting you know that something wasn't right and wasn't fair that he he just did change the thing without your permission without you knowing so in some ways you had a right to be angry but what happens what I heard you saying in as you were telling me what happened next what happened next was that your anger took charge and he it did more than what it's meant to do your your anger is just just to let you know that you're angry okay but what it did what I feel it did it just pushed you out of the road and said I'm I'm taking control here so Jane when you were angry did you feel it anywhere in your body,1
the end of the day that that pushing your sister over and yelling at your mum did,1
yes which is hard to see at the time I I do understand that but what I'm thinking is that if sometimes if we tell our anger look thank you you've done a good job it doesn't have to get so angry then because you you know you you're telling it that it's thank you you've done a good job you've let me know I'm angry now I'm going to deal with it from here,1
hi my name is Arielle and I'll be your dietician today,1
nice to meet you Emily what can I do for you today,1
have you been keeping up with your insulin injections,1
I see well looking at your anyone C value of 12 tells me that your blood sugar for the past few months has been very high we want to try and get that value down to seven when you skip your injections do you notice anything different or do you feel differently,1
okay those are actually symptoms of hyperglycemia or high blood sugar let's caused by a deficiency of insulin in the body do you know what ketoacidosis is okay when there is no insulin in the body the cells cannot get the energy they need to function to compensate that your body begins breaking down fat body this is what is referred to as ketoacidosis and this can be very life-threatening by leading to coma Oren's of your cases even death so those experiencing I'd usually have stomach pain nausea sometimes I have breath that's most fruity or like they say it smells like acetone or they have very labored reading what they call Kussmaul respirations and this is why taking your insulin injections it's very important so without it your body can't function,1
well your body is completely dependent on those injections as without them that glucose gets built up in your blood if continued hyperglycemia will develop which is very detrimental to your body and then it's not corrected quickly it will need to ketoacidosis,1
that's a good question my guess is that all the sugar it needs somewhere to go so your body gets rid of it through urine which is why you're always using the bathroom because you're gonna run up someone to fluid,1
you're basically depleting your wash stores and becoming dehydrated,1
exactly what we want to focus on is keeping your diet and insulin dosage in check also physical activity can help lower your blood sugar and help you lose weight and healthy weight what is your normal diet look like,1
well hopefully I can explain carb counting a little more in-depth for you with carb counting our goal is to spread out the consumption of carbohydrates throughout the day in order to normalize your blood glucose so in general 15 grams of carbs equals one serving of carbohydrates so this will make it easier for you and trying to determine how many units of insulin you need to take and after eat a meal so one unit of insulin for 15 grams of carbohydrates at d1 service or however your doctor tells me so how many nails and snacks do you eat today,1
okay so a starting point I would say aim for about 60 grams of carbohydrate or four servings at each meal and then between zero and 20 grams for each snack which would be about one serving of carb and also with each time you're getting your carbohydrate so at each meal make sure that you're dancing that out with some protein and fat as well so for example if you're eating like a piece of toast maybe put some peanut butter on it so that way you're getting your protein and your fat in there as well so do you know what counts as a carbohydrate,1
yes but there are cards instance of other places you find think up like fruits starchy vegetables milk yogurt and sweets and generally the next Rishon table can tell you how many carbs are in something so I haven't had that for you and on this front and up it shows you the nutrition label and it tells you the total carbohydrates and it kind of helps you break down the steps and like how to do the math so in the total carbohydrates you wants to have sugar alcohols and fiber and because you don't completely absorb those those don't quite count in your total carbohydrate so this helps you do the math on that and it makes it a lot simpler and this basically just breaks it down for you completely on the other side I hat side I have listed the some examples of foods that may not have nutrition labels on them so like fruits like apples and bananas they don't usually come with nutrition labels but on here I have like what a serving would be and we come to cards I would be for that surgery it's like one small half would be 15 grams of cards so does this make any easier,1
alright well just be sure to keep track at the top calories and fats are consuming as they can add up really fast and lead to weight gain I also recommend staying active as I can how can you lose weight and lower your blood sugar just be sure to check with your doctor on what you can do and then you should take your is one before changing up your routine,1
my pleasure I look forward to seeing you and our follow up where we'll check on your progress,1
so now I want to talk to you a little bit about some of those answers I said we would get back to okay so firstly I just want to just summarize kind of way you said that you've tried smoking cigarettes one time didn't like it you've had a few drinks a few different times over the last year at some parties and you also got a ride from someone who you knew was smoking marijuana did I get all those ready right yeah okay all right so I want to say that you know it's a good thing that you seem to not like smoking seem to have decided that you don't want to smoke I hope you would continue to you know to decide that you don't want to smoke it's also really good that you don't use anyone else's prescription medicines I know it's really tempting in high school with your busy schedule and you know just trying to use things to help you study to help keep up with your busy schedule so it's really a good thing that you that you've also avoided doing that but it really it is concerning about your drinking so i just wanted to hear a little bit more about that from you so could you just tell me a little bit about your drinking,1
okay so just to clarify so it sounds like when the one hand you know you kind of drink to fit in at your friends I'll do it that you felt kind of would help feel a little bit more comfortable in this date but on the other hand just being afraid of some of the consequences and seeing friends get sick or kind of a negative for that well well I am concerned about your drinking you know just so you know we used to think that people's brains were done developing by the time you were  but now we know that they develop well into your s and alcohol really can have an effect on developing brain cells probably that time where you didn't remember everything you did that night we call that a blackout and that's usually an indication that there's some subtle effects of the alcohol in your brain cells so so again that that's concerning not to mention that often people do things that they later regret when they're drinking so so just to think about all that and really I would recommend that you not drink at all until you turn  okay so I mean just to think about that but if I had to have you put on a scale of  to   being not at all interested  being very interested where do you think you'd be as far as your interest in stopping drinking right now ,1
okay good so now I just want to talk also about driving with the friend who was smoking marijuana yeah I mean just to make sure you understand it a lot of times people may seem fine but really they're not especially with the the skills you need to drive safely so so that's something that you one to avoid here ,1
okay yeah i think you know I've known your parents for a long time and I think they'd be understanding and willing to do what they need to do to come get you so good okay what do you have any questions no I think that's good okay so what I want to do is have you come back in a couple months and just check in to see how you're doing with with not drinking so let's see how that goes and you'll come back in a couple months and we'll we'll see how that way okay so good  ,1
so what kind of feeling is just bringing up for you,1
so I want to try to scale this we talked about this before with cognitive therapy so let's say that 10 is really the most anxious you're felt about crossing bridges right and one is no anxiety where would you be right now right now,1
all right so but even now how far away is the until they,1
so even now a week out loses it's Nate this is really hurt,1
so for your job and local travel you don't really have to cross any,1
right so no snow bridges yeah thanks probably planned it that way it's good I don't know,1
I would have to leave probably at 3 o'clock because it's only about 20 minutes to the airport really,1
but I would like to leave earlier they're probably taking up time by the time they land and to go through you know they're getting their luggages they probably won't even come out till maybe 4:30 but I'd like to make sure I'm there at around 3:30 4 o'clock,1
I have to do this to to get up and go they need me to be there this this week it's my parents coming in and they're elderly so I don't want them to be stuck at the airport there's no one else that actually can go pick them up so I have to get up and go and pick them up so,1
that is what's going through my mind that you know there's nobody else that can do this I mean it's cheaper than there's nothing I can't probably can't even afford to get a taxi for them because you'd have to cross that's from Philly to into New Jersey so that's gonna be very expensive I can't afford that when all I'd have to do is pay $5.00 for the tow and maybe gas up my car for $10 or something but hey I'll be thinking about it I have to do this and I'm not really doing it you know it's something that I can save money that way and I don't want to leave them stranded definitely someone else can I mean baby lost they're not familiar with there but in Philly the airport is crazy to me,1
um just the thought of the bridge there it's just I could drive off the bridge you know they can fall off usually what I do is try to stay in the middle lane I can't do more miles an hour and I just I'm shaking I have the radio on and windows down because I can't swim so for any reason I'm to fall off I mean that's it for me I even have a little metal one of those so I think it's an instrument that you used in the house for I don't know pliers or something is something real hard that I can hit the glass with it sits right there on my door so I'm all ready I planned and I have that I planned ahead of time I know what I'm gonna do as soon as I approach the patient but I still feel anxious,1
so before that when you can still exit what's your anxiety level,1
as soon as that getting close to getting off the bridge and now leaving that little sigh of relief there's a little release there and I know that I've been able to manage those two three minutes of cross that into how many minutes it takes actually of crossing crossing the bridge and I start feeling a little bit of relief but then again I know I have to do my back exit and there's another one coming by that so starts all over again all,1
Oh as soon as this I'm descending from the Gerrard Point Bridge there's less you know it's almost reduced I'm not coming you know really low it's almost going yes it's not Muskaan,1
and when you start thinking about that you're gonna have to cross them again,1
all right so you're you're doing everything you can to keep your car on the bridge but you're still feeling anxiety like you're gonna go off the bridge,1
yes especially when there are those big trucks tractor trailers coming,1
yes yes if it's also in bad weather or at night it's worse because on the bridge especially the top one you kind of see the sky and there's nothing else you see so it's like you're gonna fall off yes,1
all the lower level coming back it's not as bad because you're kind of like protected here and there so it's not as bad but going is definitely worse yes,1
I hear all the news once in a while you'll hear something happen or sometimes in movies you see things happen I think it's possible,1
no maybe none of that um Girard bridge because I I noticed I was checking it the other day I had to go to the airport and I was trying to measure the distance between the metal poles just to see if a car could fit there really and I think a car could fit there but you know it just depends on the angle you were hit or something or if you flipped so yeah done some thinking she's,1
I don't even recall all the anxiety know why it was such a big deal anyway I don't think about it at all,1
it would save me money how it can be the one calling the can but if people want to pick them up and save them from being stranded at the airport than being in a land that they they're not familiar with an area they're not familiar with so make sure that they're safe,1
so it clearly it sounds like you picked them up before,1
so picking them up is it's worth all the anxiety,1
that's worth it but you wish that you could do it without anxiety,1
and how long have you had that anxiety we try to approach it,1
all right developed along the way somewhere it's been with you ever since,1
so I'd like to do what kind of therapy we call a refrain and actually you've kind of already done it but I want to make it a little clearer so you suffer things I D and you suffer it to protect mostly protector your parents,1
so as you're going over the bridge you're thinking about the automatic thought we talked about these before right the thought that kind of pops in your mind is I'm gonna fly off the bridge,1
so that seems pretty unlikely all right that's not something that maybe as you talk about geometrically maybe there's some way your car could find the bridge with physics now maybe could happen but it seems like it would be do you fairly like,1
so you could challenge that and this isn't the refrain part but you could challenge that on that thought which with a statement and adapt a response like it's pretty unlikely I think it's going to happen alright that might help a bit to keep applying then the chances are vastly in your favor I could sing how many cars you cross that bridge I'm a fly off the bridge alright heard of plan out for those bridges but the other you know the refrain part is that you're you're doing this you're willing to take on the bridges and have this anxiety for the betterment of your parents for their safety,1
so in this whole equation of crossing bridges and anxiety and you're really really the good guy in this you're you're willing to you're willing to suffer and overcome a fear to make sure your parents are saying yeah I mean and you've thought about before like before you leave you think I only have to pick a month but you've never really connected it to want to be in the good guy here,1
yeah you've overcome it before to pick them up and when you pick up again you'll you'll overcome it again and you'll suffer but I the difference here is that that reframe I want you to apply that reframe when you're feeling that anxiety issue get ready to leave and as you're trapped with the bridge that you're really you know you're doing what you feel is right for the good of your family,1
all right so the automatic thought that's gonna come in in is you're gonna fly off the bridge okay that's what that's what the exoti is about Miss Spears and the reframe in this case the reframe adapter response is I'm doing I'm doing this for my family and the probabilities preloaded like the bridge that's a separate thing but the reframe is I'm no I'm the hero of this I think that's a great way to look at here to hear of this situation,1
the whole day yeah yeah just kind of go over that should rather than like something you must do because really you don't have to do it strictly speaking right I know you feel you have to do it but you're willing to do it you're willing to sacrifice and suffer to do it,1
and I'd rather that be the theme that you're getting is a positive thing that you're that you're willing to do it has to be done it's uncomfortable you'll survive it it's uncomfortable I focus on that kind of reframe then focusing on the very low probability that you're the risk that you're going to fly off the bridge so it's very low low risk,1
so it's not so much being forced to do it me forced into an extra situation you're voluntarily in brave and I know it's hard it's hard for you didn't use your say it's a 10 on the anxiety to get that's that's the highest score right so it's hard for you but the way to look at it maybe would be you're doing has to be done you to flee go your family they need you have you ever had any close calls on a bridge or anything,1
yeah and that might be another a good automatic thought or adaptive response to that on that thought is that I've always managed overcome this and it hurts but managed overcome it,1
I kind of taken charge like that and being assertive that might help reduce that automatically,1
so I'll see you again in two weeks which will give an opportunity,1
and then we'll see how things start with that and we'll move from there,1
so I'm hearing the good part about drinking is that it keeps you calm and I'm also hearing the downside about it is that you started wanting spenders and your family get a bit concerned it must be tough so what is that like for you,1
yeah so you kind of use it as a way to shift your mood a little bit yeah okay and so what what do you what would you like to do what would you like to change,1
okay so you noticing that it's kind of a little too long and so you want to find an alternative means of coping or trying to relax,1
so on a scale of zero to 100 how important do you think it is for you to make this change,1
okay so around 50 and on a scale from zero to 100 100 how confident are you in making this change,1
the good side of it is that you understand that you need help and I think that's awesome really really good for you to have that insight so I'm hearing that you're not that confident okay so from from 0 to 100 where are you,1
so in terms of importance you're around 50 in terms of confidence it's less than 50 so I'm hearing that it's important you know that it's important for you to make that change but in terms of confidence you're not that confident okay so what do you think it would take to help build that confidence,1
so I'm hearing that you you would like someone to help keep you accountable and also to help encourage you and motivate you towards making this change and and this is the reason why you mentioned your belief system before and if I if it's okay if I may ask your permission what the people at your church be some of the people that you can turn to for some of the the accountability and you know help motivate you to change,1
right so I hear you say I want to get right and I kind of hear that willingness to want to change can you tell me 103 best reasons for you to make this change,1
okay so some of the things I'm hearing is that you might want to do it for your mother and I'm hearing that you would want to achieve this you're maturing on in life and so for you and what's another one,1
some hearing when you wake up you've had a drink in the morning right before breakfast,1
and by that time you're calm and you're loose and anything you just get a little belligerent okay it's causing you to get kicked out a lot of places you know and I'm hearing them you're saying that that's no way to live and so you no longer want that yeah and the good the good thing about what I'm hearing is that you have friends,1
well care enough to notice what's going on and bring it to your attention by recording you,1
and something your buddies have in common right,1
yeah and so help is available I have a few substance abuse places that I'd like to refer you to and maybe some hey have you heard of alcohol Anonymous meetings as we mentioned before support group and your church as you mentioned so these are the avenues that you said you would like to go into,1
absolutely absolutely it definitely helped me with strategies and you know a lot of affirmation and helping you to get there control that you said that you wanted these are definitely some and great place is to go into to help you get your life back sound like what I'm hearing you say,1
okay so we've talked about where you are in terms of wanting change we talked about where you act as far as feeling confident in change we also discussed a little bit about the reasons why you want to change the three reasons you mentioned your mom you mentioned for yourself you mentioned your health in the session we also discussed some avenues that you may take in terms of getting that support that you want we talked about your belief system a little bit we talked about church we talked about referrals in places that you may be interested in so you talked about a lot and I want to hear from you how is this going for you how how was the session been going for you in the past the last session that we had before,1
yeah well thank you I'm glad that you have had a wonderful experience in terms of speaking with me today and I'm glad that you've also decided on what you want to do in terms of making those changes for your life and I'm glad that I can I can be a partner in helping you to achieve those things I really really appreciate it so if there are any goals that you would like to achieve for our next session or in the future,1
yeah yeah wonderful session okay we'll go ahead and schedule those referrals,1
so the marijuana has real value for you but you don't want to see going ,1
you take the marijuana for any other reason other than to help with the anxiety ,1
so and you may not be able to answer this question but if you didn't have any anxiety would that change your motivation to use marijuana,1
so sounds like a real passion for this type of work and and really the big obstacle here is this marijuana ,1
yeah it's a predicament yeah you're kind of weighing both sides of this right now I'm wondering do you have you think you have like a physical craving for the marijuana ,1
so you're really using it recreationally and as an anti-anxiety agents ,1
so if you were I know you didn't have great success before in therapy we want to combat anxiety but if you were being treated for anxiety and working that job which seems like you would really like do you think you would be able to stay away from marijuana,1
would having the job that you're passionate about reduce your anxiety ,1
you're frustrated marijuana is illegal yeah it's yeah at the same time it's the reality you're living it right yeah it's I think it will be legalized and like in the state in a couple years but until the end like I mean I can't wait that long to start start working so ,1
until then you still need to address this dilemma ,1
so you have choices here right you can continue to use marijuana and take the job right and that seems like something that has some advantages for you but some some disadvantages right because you would really like that job,1
so what do you think you are in terms of making this change you feel motivated to take some steps toward it ,1
so you definitely say you definitely need it so you can't give up the marijuana unless you have some other available alternative that would help with that anxiety right that's that's key to you to make this change yeah but at the same time that would be ideal because then you could take the job,1
so with anxiety reduction your chances of stopping marijuana increase and then you could take the child that you want yeah yeah I've been notably the best best outcome is that the outcome you would most want,1
so here's what I'm thinking and let me know what you think about this when you come back next week right what if we start looking at this anxiety if we start you know I start treating this anxiety you know I see if we can get it reduced and kind of work from there because maybe when you start to feel if that works and that anxiety starts to abate it sounds like it'll just be easier for you to stop the marijuana usage yeah what kind of time frame are you on terms of taking this job ,1
so you're fortunate in the sense that the turnover is high right because it gives you opportunity to apply later on so do you feel like you could invest in that plan let's work on the anxiety see what happens with marijuana see if we can reduce your usage of it or have you stopped that all together and then kind of move toward this job ,1
alright so the next time you come in we'll start talking about the anxiety and let's see what we can do about that move from there all right yeah it sounds good that's good thanks Scott thank you  ,1
yeah I mean and I thought a lot more about it this week after I mentioned it last week but a joke I was telling you about Jill my coworker and you know she was kind of bothering me in the past couple weeks but really this this past week was like the worst right so she's not doing her paperwork and the thing is is that she has to do these reports in order for me to do my reports so if she doesn't have hers I can't do mine and then I can't get mine out in time for the next person to do their it's a mess the whole thing's a mess and it's just it's annoying me,1
yeah yeah it definitely is and it it's one of those things that like you know has it gives me a bad a bad evaluation you know like it if I'm not eating my stuff in in time then it reflects negatively on me you know and it's it's all kind of she's she's the first level you know and then all the other levels are kind of dependent on her turning things in on time so she doesn't then I don't then the next person and so forth,1
right yeah and my boss doesn't like it my boss's boss doesn't like it so forth you know and I try to explain to them you know she's the problem but it doesn't always I don't always have the time to go up and tell them like here's what's happening or it just somehow it doesn't come out,1
yeah and that's pretty annoying too because you know it's one thing if people get mad at me but then I'm able to tell them why I'm not doing my job like I'm supposed to but it's another thing for them to get me into me not realizing my fault you know,1
yeah I did I do that's the thing but I can't always get it out you know I can't always tell the person that's has the complain about and yeah I mean I tried talking to my my boss and I tried talking other people too you know but really hasn't gotten anywhere,1
yeah yeah I mean I talked to Jill a little bit about it too you know and I tried to ask I tried kind of gently reminding her you know like such-and-such needs to be turned in by Tuesday at 12 o'clock yeah I didn't want to be real abrasive you know but I I tried to remind,1
yeah yeah and it didn't didn't really seem to work because it's still happening,1
no it really hasn't and and that's just I feel like I've tried everything that I could try you know and even like I came home and I was talking to a friend about it and I was trying to think of other solutions right you know I was trying to think like what else I could do what else I could say who else I could talk to things like that you know and I mean my friend you know he was listening in staffing had some good suggestions but it he didn't know what to do either like cuz he doesn't know the way the company so like I got nothing,1
yeah not at all feeling pretty lost with it and then I wish it was just like a clearer way to do things like this is what you should do now and I don't see anything,1
yeah yeah but I yeah I don't I don't see a way to go about it I mean I so I right so this is the way I lay down my mind I tried talking to the people above me mm-hmm didn't work out the way I thought it would I tried talking to the people below me so to speak just lower on the before me in the process that's what I mean and that didn't work out which it's just Jill and I talked to her and that didn't work so like there's nowhere else I could turn,1
you've thought about a letter but who would you send it to,1
so everyone will hear your complaint and maybe react in a way to help you,1
it feels better now as you're contemplating and another potential Avenue here,1
well this might be a good place to wrap this session up that feels like the right move for you,1
and well schedule so I see you next week and we can pick up from there,1
for coming in um so I'm not sure how much you know already about sort of what you're doing here if it's okay I'll give you a little rundown so basically we're here I'm just going to talk to you for a little bit about sort of what your goals are for your life get to know you a little bit better and talk about some different behaviors that you might be engaging in it's not my job at all to judge you or to try and change you you know basically I'm going to talk to you about how things are going any changes you might want to make in your life how I could help you with that and just what I can do that's going to be most beneficial for you that's not okay all right so I guess just to get started can you tell me a little bit about yourself,1
okay and what kinds of things do a plan for your life ,1
yeah so kind of keeping your options open yeah definitely great and you have an idea about what you might want to study or yeah maybe I'm pre-law oh wow okay that's exciting ,1
yeah all right cool um what do you like to do for fun ,1
yeah and you have a lot of friends or a few close people or ,1
so um it sounds like in general your things are going pretty well for you how are your grades right now um they're pretty good a zombie's so ,1
well one thing I want to ask about is you know different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them they might you know be really close with family or really have you know their friends as being something particularly important I'm going to show you just a few things on this sheet and if you can look more so there's things like belonging community cultural identity family friendship modesty religion respect self-determination and spirituality which of those do you think is sort of important to you ,1
okay what's important to you about your family ,1
wanting to be part of a group yeah kind of okay great all right well one of the things I want to talk about is you know you mentioned that you like to go out with friends and party and that sort of a thing and I'm curious when you're at the parties do you ever have any alcohol ,1
okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into your overall social scene ,1
okay you're kind of getting pressure from other people who are drinking and it feels easier for you to hold a drink ,1
how often do you think that you are one or two weekends of the most very much so,1
one or two weekends a month you're in a situation where there is alcohol yeah okay and what sort of situations are you in ,1
yeah are you ever places where there are parents around or are mostly just just with the kids ,1
yeah do you ever go anywhere in a car after you've had any alcohol definitely no I've never drunk driven and I've never been in a car with a drunk driver ,1
so that's something that you've sort of made a decision about that sounds I know that's extremely dangerous okay what do you know about how that's dangerous,1
you're really trying to be safe and and make sure that you're not putting yourself in those situations that's great you know it's it's tough to do sometimes and I really commend you for being able to to stick with that yeah so you mentioned you pretty much will like hold a drink or maybe have a drink or two what do you thinks the most alcohol you've ever had in in one day ,1
what kinds of things do you like about alcohol um,1
mm-hmm so it just kind of makes you feel relaxed yeah okay relax okay anything else ,1
so you've seen a lot of other kids you had some consequences and decided that's not for you yeah ,1
got it I can understand that any other things that you can think of ,1
okay well so you know as someone who's not  yet it is underage drinking is something that's not legal and it is something that is considered pretty risky so I'm wondering what you think about that just in terms of how it fits into your life ,1
so it's kind of something that here it's just there it's just there okay and I'm curious you mentioned you know your friends are important to you and your family's important to you sort of fitting in as important to you and how does alcohol play a role with that ,1
so from your family perspective the drinking is not something that fits very well yeah and with friends you feel like it's easier to hang out with alcohol or maybe you wouldn't have as much fun or your friends wouldn't like you as much ,1
well when you think about your drinking and sort of looking forward and five years or ten years how do you think that drinking might fit in with your life ,1
can you expand on that a little bit more what do you mean ,1
so the alcohol is something that might make it harder to reach your goals yeah definitely so when you're sort of looking ahead how often do you think you might be drinking say when you get to college ,1
so you sort of have a plan to cut back on your drinking eventually how might that go ,1
yeah you don't feel the need to make any major changes but you feel like you could make some adjustments that doesn't get ya that's a good word okay how important is it to you to make some adjustments to your drinking on a scale of one to ten where one is not at all important not something you're thinking about and ten is the most important thing ,1
why did you say five or six rather than like two or three ,1
yeah okay and how confident are you that you could make a change if you decide you wanted to on that same scale ,1
so what number do you think you'd say um on the scale ,1
why'd you say eight or nine rather than even like five or six ,1
it sounds like you do have sort of a vague plan to make some adjustments in your drinking at some point yes and it's moderately important to you it's something you would like to do because you have these big goals for yourself and you actually feel very confident that you could be successful with it what sort of goal do you think might be good to set for today ,1
do you feel pretty confident that you could just stop completely ,1
what might be some benefits of falling through with that goal ,1
it's it sounds like you're actually pretty comfortable with setting a goal of not drinking any more at least at the next party and seeing how it goes yeah okay do you think it would be alright if we met again to kind of check in on how it goes and see if it's working out for you yeah that would be okay alright great and then ,1
it sounds like some of the benefits you're expecting are health benefits having an easier time with achieving your academic and career goals and just sort of not having to deal with some of the consequences that your peers do right okay well very good is there anything else that you think would be important for me to know,1
that's a great question so a lot of times kids who are trying to cut back it's harder if their friends are still drinking and one of the easiest things is trying to have more activities that don't involve alcohol but of course that's harder if you're not the one planning so some of the things that can be useful if you're at a party say and there's already alcohol there and there are other kids that maybe aren't your closest friends some of the things that I would recommend since you're interested are you know carrying around a different drink that looks like it has alcohol in it so you know even carrying an empty beer bottle or beer can or you know if people are having a mixed drink just having the coke say without any all mixed into it often having anything in your hand is a good barrier for people who are trying to offer you alcohol because you already have something in it kind of prevents them from trying to stuff something else in there do you think any of those things might work for you ,1
okay what about in terms of talking to your friends about it have you thought about how you might approach with them or is that something else you'd like some tips about about telling them about your plan too I need to stop drinking I was just planning on playing them that I don't really want to drink anymore that wasn't me uh-huh no your friends would be pretty comfortable with that yeah I mean now it's my closest friends for sure okay great any other concerns or questions anything else I go but no I think I'm okay okay so then like I said I'll try and see if we can meet up maybe in a few weeks and see how it's going and then if things are going great then fantastic and if you run into any stumbling blocks and we can maybe problem solve together okay great that's sound okay yeah all  ,1

hi I'm Amy the pharmacist so I understand you have some questions,1
sure why don't you tell me a little bit about what you're thinking how soon you'd like to quit and why you want to quit,1
that's correct quitting would be important for you and it will reduce your chances of having heart problems,1
hmm I'd be happy to do that first tell me exactly which products you used and more importantly how you use them,1
based on what you've told me it sounds like you didn't get the full benefit of the product a few pieces of gum won't get enough nicotine into your body to make you comfortable you need at least nine pieces a day for it to be effective and it has to be used in a very specific way not chewed like regular chewing gum,1
as for the patch sounds like it worked for you you just didn't stay on it long enough we recommend 10 to 12 weeks and this gets enough nicotine into your body to help reduce most of the withdrawal symptoms while you work on learning to live your life without cigarettes you were able to quit for a week with it so it seems like it might be a good choice now but there are others as well,1
well that's understandable but you should know there are new flavors that my patients say tastes better to be honest all the medications are effective it's just a matter of what you prefer you've already tried the patch there's also a nicotine lozenge a nasal spray an oral inhaler in tablet form we have bupropion which you've probably heard called zyban and there's a newer medication varenicline or chantix,1
sounds like a good choice for you and given that you have some experience with it and you know that it works for you um how many cigarettes do you smoke a day,1
okay so you'll want to start with the 21 milligram patch for six weeks and then the 14 milligram patch for two weeks and then the seven milligram patch for the last two weeks it's pretty easy to use in the morning of your quit day I want you to put one patch on a hairless part of your upper body and leave it on for 24 hours and the next morning you take that off you put another patch on in a different location you want to switch site so you don't get any skin irritation if you have trouble sleeping you can take it off before you go to bed you read the directions on the box and if you have any questions let me know,1
one more thing there are two parts to smoking so there are two parts to quitting it's an addiction to nicotine and a habit the patch will take care of the physical addiction and help with the withdrawal symptoms but you'll have to make changes in your behavior if you want to stay quit for good,1
that's perfect our stay quit line is excellent and convenient so let's talk about picking a quit date and we'll get you set up with a box of patches,1
so where you said you'd like to start Sal is talking about your asthma and specifically about your dog and how one is affecting the other,1
hmm so what can you let me know or or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse,1
okay and that your pet has never been mentioned as a concern,1
hmm yeah and I I can see that you've already worked hard to make some changes you've almost quit smoking you're just down to your last couple of cigarettes and you're not even smoking those in the house and your house is totally smoke-free,1
okay and you have also thought about cutting back on alcohol and and I think you mentioned done done a little bit towards that,1
okay so now almost like that's not good enough like now you have to douse the dog and I mean and now what what's next,1
so I mean there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar you know when he's in the house or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him what happens with your asthma symptoms,1
hmm so it doesn't make total sense to you that that it's all Oscars fault and then that's the only solution,1
I guess I also wonder whether regardless of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been such a big part of your life for so long,1
mmm yeah and and in the end you know whatever you whatever you do about Oscar about your asthma about all the other things that we talked about on that agenda setting worksheet I mean you are in the driver's seat salad it really is your choice,1
there's a lot of decisions and a lot of change with your wife with the new baby and and now thinking about looking after your health and wanting to be healthy for your wife and your baby,1
mm-hmm so what what would need to happen or how would you know when you win or if you ever did have to make a decision about whether to keep Oscar with you or not,1
oh yeah and it got the feeling that it's something that you want to think about that this is a really big decision and it's not one that you're gonna make in a hurry,1
so right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life it's been a part of your life off and on for 18 years it's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought I'll never smoke then,1
and your worry is that if you stop you will end up gaining weight so I'm hearing this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive about stopping I'm wondering what else might be on that list,1
mm-hmm okay yeah so added to the other other list is they're having to go through the withdrawal the unpleasantness of that,1
what else might be on the not-so-good side about smoking and that's talking,1
so so tell me what that feeling of disgust is what are you disgusted about,1
yeah well it sounds like there's some judgments in there right so it sounds like probably you're having some judgments like I'm feeling really bad yeah,1
but but you did say it more descriptively which is great which is you're feeling uncomfortable right now,1
yeah and I can totally understand how you get to there if you're thinking I'm feeling fat I'm going to get fat you know it's an easy place to get to okay,1
but I feel like we're missing something too because I don't think it's just discussed I think there's another primary emotion in there what do you think that might be,1
I think that's exactly right that's what I'm seeing you know I see you kind of curled up over there you know you have a very worried face you know and you're having a hard approaching it I think I think that's absolutely right that you're feeling fear and I want you to know that makes a lot of sense to me you know when's the last time you've eaten cheesecake,1
I know it's been it's been a really long time he certainly didn't need it all through you know when you were really stuck in your eating disorder you know I used to,1
and so you've been avoiding food like this for so long that it totally makes sense that you're feeling fear,1
and you had said this is one of the hardest foods for you so that makes sense to me,1
that's what what what is that it's a big Wobbuffet,1
yeah exactly you know I'm not gonna let you get away with saying stuff like that all right,1
so because that's just not going to be helpful right now so what I'm wondering is since we know that it's fear that we're dealing with maybe if we can do some opposite action to that emotion do you remember what I mean by opposite action,1
right exactly so you know fears associated with that urge like you said to run out the door so instead of running out the door we want you to approach the thing that's scary which is this cheesecake right now right,1
okay so I see how hard it is for you and I honestly it's hard for me to watch and I wish I could just take that away but as you know the reason opposite action is so important is if you if I just take that fear away by saying no more cheesecake it's just going to make you more fearful the next time you come in front of some kind of food that's tough for you make it work yeah so by doing this hopefully over time your fear all go down okay,1
so can we have the fear right now and still take a few more bites all right,1
no I wouldn't imagine it would but you did perfect opposite action right there which is you are feeling really uncomfortable and I can tell that but you still did it,1
okay so this shows me that you can do it so let's try again let's take a breath and then we'll go back and do more opposite action,1
hi Lucy nice to see you today how you been going,1
great I'm just fully get started has anything changed with your medical history since I last saw you like any new medications or serious operations,1
great and is anything maybe worrying you about your teeth or your gums today,1
mmm well let's lie you back I'll pop some gloves on and we'll have a little look Lucy it definitely looks like you need a filling um I'd love to help you figure out why you've got this new hole in your tooth do you mind if I ask you a few questions so we can try and figure it out,1
great well here's a risk assessment form it's just a few questions that might help us figure out what the problem might be,1
great yeah it says here that you're drinking soft drinks in between meals what do you know about the effect of soft drinks on your teeth,1
that's right um the bacteria in your mouth can use the soft drink to create acid that eats into the tooth surface and causes the holes the more that your teeth are coated in the sugar the more likely it is that you'll develop a hole did you know the one can of soft drink can have 10 teaspoons of sugar in it,1
yeah I understand it does sound like you're worried about getting holes in your teeth though there are a few options that you can do to help improve how you consume sugar would you like to hear about those,1
yeah probably drinking soft drink you could try drinking it all in one go instead of sipping on it or you could try drinking just at mealtimes instead of in between meals so does either of those sound like they might work for you,1
great I'm in Romania to get a break from the sugar I sort of on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most how motivated do you feel you are to make this change,1
great and you maybe have any ideas that you could implement to help you avoid having soft drinks in between meals,1
great that's a really good strategy and waters great for you too umm you can also try chewing sugar-free gum I mean is that something you're interested in,1
okay cool well look I'll put a little note in your file and the next time I see you if it's okay I'll check how you're going with avoiding soft drinks between meals,1
thinking that wait so why are you here today it'll be a any specific reason sir,1
oh that's actually very common today with medications doing it by a natural healthy lifestyle so she said you have text red beans did she tell you anything about that or I will level are we right now with the understanding of what type 2 diabetes is,1
well I'm here for you so what type 2 diabetes is is in your body that working called your pancreas secretes this insulin excrete hormone called insulin and what the insulin does is takes up the glucose that's in your blood it brings it into yourselves that they use for energy and in your case your body is still producing insulin but it's just not either producing enough or it's having trouble getting it into the cells for various reasons or you're producing it it's just not working your body loses insulin resistant right now so do you know why your cells need the glucose,1
yes exactly it's due form of energy and your brain needs a minimum level of glucose to function along with all your other organs so by not getting that insulin or by not getting the glucose into yourselves there's some sense there's starving going to ketoacidosis a lot of complications can happen with that so it's very important to maintain blood glucose and control your Sugar's with a type 2 diabetes,1
yes that's a very good cause of it so yeah that's perfect so well let's talk about your daily routine in your diet and see how that plays into it right now so what do you do on a normal day or what times would she be okay,1
okay so have you ever considered maybe trying to buy like different made whole grain bread or whole grain pasta,1
okay okay so you know that you need to not control your blood glucose levels right to maintain the healthy lifestyle so what are your goal is to try and do that or why why would you want to do that,1
so and then the exercise that's going to help by reducing the adipose tissue around your cells which will make it easier for the insulin to pick up the glucose and bring it into your cells so losing weight is always a key part in maintaining diet or helping to control diabetes and even if you're not necessarily using weight doing the exercise one really help you gain more muscle mass which what is the bad news and both is just another word for fat is it late with that around yourselves adipose tissue is that too soon yeah so okay so we've gone over some brainstorming ideas so let's pick some two or three things that we can really focus on so for next time maybe we can hopefully see a little luck because um before I said the doctor happened to give you a glucose meter do you know what that is or,1
that is what are you prick you maker yes and that will tell you what your blood glucose is so remind me at the end of thing and we can give you one of those if that sounds like a good option and then we can start having blood glucose readings and that will also manage your blood sugar that's a way to,1
well that will let you know where your blood glucose is so say in the mornings generally your blood who was this putting much lower because you've gone all night not having anything to eat you're gonna start the day fresh but at night it's kind of obvious that you've got all day you're eating you're tired your body's gone through a rough day your blood Sugar's public we're generally much more higher so if we have glucose readings say next time when you come in we can say see where you're at see if they're generally starting to decrease of what we're doing is helping or not and then you can go from there always and hopefully that will help so you won't have to run the medicine,1
usually we want to try and keep your blood Sugar's under 100 and especially in the morning waking up not having anything in your system I know 100 be a good number at night of course it's going to be a little bit higher so 120 80 would say we're trying to keep anything under there and you know what if you mess up and they're higher that's okay because things happen you may have wanted to go to a party that day eat a cake you know anything so things are going to fluctuate but if we come back and you generally have lower glucose that's as much that's very good sign much better for your body so so okay so I'll call these pretty serving things what do you think we can what are like two or three main things that you choose that you will focus on,1
yeah and you always don't have to switch by it over either we can say go to the grocery store this time by white bread the next time I buy whole wheat bread or make your pasta half white half wheat things like that under sandwiches maybe one slice of white bread once it's we brighten everything up whatever work for you and also does your husband eat well or,1
okay so that's perfect do you think it's a good support,1
yeah exactly and you know what maintaining your health and maintaining his health is just going to better the both of you anyway so it's always nice to have someone to help support you and what you're doing and going on the walks,1
and if instead of staying or going on a walk everyday maybe you can go every other day with him but it's a learning process so you don't have to jump into everything right away as long as you're taking the initiative now and trying that's always what's gonna help so if it goes wrong it is okay so let's go back and summarize what we've decided you know some be the three goals that,1
okay perfect and do you what times do you think will work good for testing for you or do you have an idea of how you'll like keep a journal maybe or,1
in the morning and then you'll know what you are for the day you go from there they said that sounds good to me so you seem very motivated and excited like you want to get better and that's always a good sign,1
I agree that's yeah it's a mingle a lot of people healthy lifestyle so okay do you plan on coming back and see an appointment for next time or,1
okay does three months okay and that way we can give you a long time because well look at your anyone see again your anyone see is a measure of how sticky your blood is basically and so it's a three month measure so you would take it two or three months it'll tell you how much sugar and stuff on to the red blood cells of your body basically so we can see if it's higher or lower it'll tell how you're doing and so,1
that would be a good indicator where you're at next time I see you,1
yes there it goes okay hi I'm Sheila I'll be your pharmacist today um first can you describe by your name and birth date,1
okay that's good enough I just wanna make sure I have the right person and so I have three things for you today is that when you're expressing,1
okay I just wanted to take a minute and go through these with you all right okay great I was like - these are results for you we have the Lance's insulin which is your long-acting insulin and then we have the metformin catalyst cannot look like what you've been picking,1
okay great and so I'm how do you be using these,1
okay great and then on this it says 48 units are you still taking that much or,1
okay and have you noticed any side effects or any problems with these but I can help you in,1
okay all right well it looks like they decided to add another influence and so what this is is novalog which is also called a smart insulin looks like um this one is one that you're gonna actually I should rephrase that and what did your how did your doctor tell you to take this,1
right okay great and um why did your doctor amasses,1
alright okay great so um you're right you're going to use this with meals and you're going to actually try to get before you eat so that may be a little bit difficult because you're going to estimate how much carbohydrate you're going to eat before you actually eat it so it might be a little dicey at first um try to help you with that um what did your doctor tell you to expect with the medication,1
okay now with insulin there's some things that we'd like to that sometimes can be a problem too like hypoglycemia have you experience animal,1
oh okay great and usually keep something on you then okay it's going to be even more important now that you're going to be doing it so basically you're going to start with the one unit for 15 grams of carbohydrate and that might be a little bit abstract for you so I don't know if you've ever done carb counting before so I got you some information um this is just a general like nutrition facts thing that you would see on a food label,1
so they make it really easy for you guys it just says right here a total carbohydrate so this is per serving though so I wanted to draw your attention to the top where it says it's serving size is you might have to do a little bit math here like on this one a serving size is one ounce but there's four servings in there bad,1
if you ate the whole bag you would have to multiply this by 4,1
umm right for a unit right because this is almost 15 or,1
right so you would use for a units of insulin to cover a full bag of it so that's how you do the math,1
now unfortunately this is more of a general average and since you're just starting on it it's probably not going to be realistic so what you're going to want to do is monitor this monitor your blood sugar and any type of like thing you can sense that you have when you first start this is um mainly a really like a range and some people leave one unit for like 9 grams and cards and some people need one unit for like 30 grams of carbs so it's really going to be dependent on how sensitive you are to insulin,1
yeah you might have to go up or down just depending on how you react so what I would suggest is keeping like a log with you I don't know if you're logging your blood sugar reading and like a paper log or if you're just keeping it in your letter,1
yeah it might be good idea to have like a moment of madness you just when you get started so you can kind of figure out exactly how many units you need per amount of carbs just as far as what you respond to yeah,1
you know this is just another little thing about when you first start getting used to counting carbohydrates just grant information for you so um I know you've been on the Lantis and it's an injectable how have you been doing the injection,1
okay now that we're adding another influence you're going to be adding three more injections a day perhaps so I gave you a little chart here there are other places on your body that you can inject other than your abdomen so it might be a good idea because you really do want to rotate by Senora tation okay um so you're pretty familiar with how to use a syringe then,1
okay you have a sharps container at home to secure the needles great okay so just to refresh they're only going to be using a couple of units at a time with this so I'm each each mark on here is a one unit and it goes up to 50 so pretty easy at least it's not done by twos or anything,1
okay um so we've gone over a lot of information and just to make sure I didn't leave anything out we've come through a lot of stuff here um can you just tell me how you're going to use these,1
I think it's actually great and yeah I just wanted to maybe ask another question about um you know what kind of exercise habits we have or how is your blood pressure been I noticed that as far as what information I have it was a little high which is something it concerns us with diet medication so I would have even,1
okay what kind of barriers are standing in the way of that,1
okay um as far as your back pain and what is the root cause of your family you know if it's like something that maybe a chiropractor or massage might help there's the low impact exercise maybe a hope it for you I don't know maybe you can bring it up your doctor or two or Long's we're gonna be getting on something like just walking or like a stationary bike or even swimming if any of those are things that you can implement it'd be a really good improvement come and anyone needs much insulin -,1
one other quick little thing is that um so insulin and your amount of exercising and activity kind of go hand-in-hand so if you start to exercise more all of a sudden you may need less insulin so once you get started on this and you know how much you're going to use per how many carbs it may change with you come around which is a good thing yeah but just keep in mind because you may have more hypoglycemic events if you don't alter,1
yeah exactly so what other questions you have for me,1
um it should hopefully stay blind not get any worse I'm not sure if it will repair at all I don't think it will but it's best to stop it now you know I stopped their progression so the better control you have the better it should be as far as not getting worse but I've definitely something it's gonna be important - especially your occupation so so yeah getting under control - great a great thing,1
all right well thank you very much and give me a call if anything comes up I have some more information for you here which is very much just what we've gone over but that we can write all right,1
so I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here so I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself basically my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in and thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life if you decide that you do it's not my job to change you I couldn't even if I wanted to that's not my role at all it's really to help you think about you know how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward that sound okay all right so why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself ,1
wow you really are involved in music yeah when did you start ,1
very cool I've always wanted to be good at music it all right so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun ,1
tell me a little bit about your family  uh well I have one older brother he's about eight and a half old years older than me my parents and I have dog ,1
cute what kind of dogs the golden retriever oh nice okay big boy very fun ,1
alright and how are things going in school for you ,1
great so you're doing well what sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school ,1
have some pretty big dreams yeah it's great that's really exciting to think about that and you're going to be looking forward to the future and those things all right well one thing I'm going to ask you about is um you know different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life whether it's you know their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies things like that so here's a little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community again cultural identity or family friendship modesty religion respect self-determination and spirituality so when you think about yourself which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life,1
respect okay can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three ,1
okay great so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging like you said a sense of purpose in the way and then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing and not just authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you okay that's great all right well one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends ,1
when you're hanging out with friends is there ever alcohol involved ,1
okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene uh well it's mostly just for for parties or party settings it's kind of to get things going and getting loosened up as they say mm-hmm and,1
so when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking ,1
mm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink ,1
okay and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus and that you're playing board games ,1
okay so there's sort of pros and cons em yes okay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol ,1
okay so sort of in the the too much drinking or times can you tell me some of the less good things are not so good things about alcohol ,1
hmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some something's happening yeah can you tell me a little bit about that,1
yeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened ,1
uh-huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol our people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much ok any other not so good things about the alcohol ,1
so you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean this video yeah got it ok all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions ,1
ok yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect to so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then it sort of defeats the purpose and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of glass lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that ,1
okay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but without crossover okay and what have you come up with at this point you have sort of a limit that you stick to or I,1
do you feel that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think ,1
so a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like I'd like to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself ,1
uh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important and ten is it's the most important thing,1
why did you say six or seven rather than like a four um because I still think it's it's important ,1
yeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for yourself okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to I think on that same scale from one to ten ,1
oh wow okay why did you say  it's just because i know that once i make the decision I know I can do it making the decision in the first place okay weather ,1
okay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that ,1
so sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than your drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or ,1
so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going I think so that's good does that sound like something you'd like to do okay well I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school and you know becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there and it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down an alcohol and that you know there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body in your health your school performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much so yeah you know it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again and be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going like all right great so I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks hurted thanks   ,1
ok so what's nothing to me is that your doctor saying you have an issue a health issue at your cholesterol and nearly an allison issue of this present time cycle,1
ok so you sound a little we're very resistant to change,1
so this is the first time you went to the doctor he makes an account with your high cholesterol okay so how long ,1
okay so what do you thing to do to help resolve the issue ,1
okay will sound like you have it this semester issue the food thing you are not great to give up but exercising to be a possible Avenue just to lower your cholesterol levels ok so how motivated are you today start like a rigorous exercise routine ,1
so what could you do this week to start now once you've in this office today to have lower your cholesterol ,1
okay have you know participant in an exercise program before ,1
okay knows me a lot of work and I respect your decision that you are not ready to give the food but you have a decision to make good choices it is your choice to do with you,1
is it D but this is too much for you like you're incapable of this this is beyond you you can now show your dad ,1
so how would you know if you're not happy until you try it ,1
okay so you say motivated like a  or a  mm is that the highest like today that you've been or wish your motivation,1
okay it is promised been going on for how many watts or ,1
okay so this is like neglect for the three or four years pretty much but you are little motivated now ,1
okay so cuz you're a little motivated he said I'm six or seven we can maybe establish a pan for you so we listen good a doctor your clothes will be lower than what it was just this present month that'd be good sorry the plan sorry your plan  ,1
so why don't you tell a little bit about yourself,1
just sounds like you're really busy all the time yeah,1
um actually no not really I only live a couple hours away but my parents come here not frequently but enough that i get to see them so you say they play basketball,1
well I've been struggling with some anxiety issues lately and I can't seem to figure out why I just I've been having some like anxiety attacks and panic attacks just wasn't like the last couple months and I thought him just go away on their own and like they think has come on at night sometimes or at first I thought they were centered around like papers and normal collops things but then like I had one were fall break whenever I didn't have anything to do looking to be here,1
I don't think into this and I mean it's a big school of constant thing so it's my senior year or two and I had to pop up until now so I I don't know I can't really figure out what could be causing it,1
I'm dinner going well my little sister actually she's a freshman in college this year so my parents are at home with the emptiness and trying to figure out what i'm going to do with their free time and call me a lot i went off a lot but I mean everything's fine I see my grandparents pretty often my sister is going well,1
socially everything is going well too just trying to keep everything balanced it's a but I mean I feel like I'm doing a pretty good job of it,1
yeah and i will say that senior year brings you know the senioritis around sometime so it's hard to get some motivation in there but um I mean schools would well like I I'm happy with my grades are socially I'd say that I mean my friends are still there like I love my friends I'm i feel like i do the same things that is nothing different going on,1
so I had probably five or six within the past month a couple of them happen at night only who actually most only the only one happy birthday but I wasn't like around anybody see any patterns with that at a loss,1
um actually I have they're just been like weird dreams that it's like I don't know it kind of plays on the future a lot but then like whenever i wake up i can't remember like specific details from it like you have you had a dream where you it feels so really you wake up and you Cameron really what just happened,1
she is in school at Spelman in Atlanta so she is having fun hopefully studying oh no she's not playing sports she just ran their students,1
yeah I was I don't know cuz every time I talk to her she's like like they have a lot of going on down there Nixon is it Lana like it's my Burlington North Carolina so I talked to her I'm like when you ever study I don't really you know every time I talk to your do it comes you too jealous but we should,1
I feel like scared I feel almost like a pressure like I can't breathe you type of thing but more like a scared feeling,1
well the first time it happened like I never had before so I didn't know what's going on and I was like in my room just about a little bit not doing anything in particular so the first time it really scared me and then you know it took me a few seconds just like started reading my guardian graduate and then a house wine so I think the more they happened I hope they will just call myself down and just keep going few minutes later and not think about it but I don't want them to keep all right well,1
yeah I've seen any doctor like I don't have a weird thing with like taking medicine everything I want to be supplied with always like home,1
really good um I want to seniors on the team so everybody's looking up to me so it's a little bit of pressure but i like i like it it's different you know our team's different,1
it's it's hard to compare this team to like other years and I mean it's kind of like unknown going into it just like you have a heavy patient because there's young you know two layers yeah we were going you taking my captain girl you'd say that oh just stepping into whatever goal the coaches want me in want me to 70 keep me like I'm trying to be a leader like vocally and it's different for me because I'm not used to being so vocal about it,1
I can just always pressure there but I guess it's like a little more pressure just because he had a lot of the,1
um I guess not I think about it I mean I am a little bit um so like my GPA is it's pretty good I have a like 33 I'm pretty close till you at 36 Soleil I'm trying to keep it up like a 35 the rest of the year and we depart of zoo but doesn't aiming for yeah so yeah yeah but it's all like a pressure go myself like nobody's really like telling me I have to do it just for or else but it's just something that kind of doing,1
well I'm the treasure in my sorority but we we had a lab new members come in last year some kind of like showing them the ropes kind of likes taking steps back you know like them starting to read some things so it's not really that much pressure in that,1
yeah I think I'd rather do that then have so much free time,1
I'll have to do is probably sleep it like egg sleep or watch TV you know or Netflix,1
so my parents are from Greensboro my grandparents on both sides actually still live in greensboro so they're 20 mins away if that they all come to my games pretty much every home game if season tickets but I don't create my advice he said tickets but my family so uh I mean we're like I really close I don't know like I don't go see them like very often maybe like once a month but I try to go see them at least once a month or once every other month version like that but I see them so much because they come to my games I was like,1
yeah well yeah this is why don't I go home that often either obsess my parents quite a bit to my sister like I thought it like she's a freshman in college so she's having fun um I'm seven actually just had laser their homecoming this past week so I know she's been busy so yeah oh my mom's birthday last week president again yeah we're pretty close,1
yeah I mean I kind of have a plan of what i want to do blood change changing you know it's just like funny hearing some people you know like have their first job offer sounds like,1
not yet but I feel like it might I probably will in the spring right now I'm still like I still feel like really invested in elon so I still feel like I'm here yet so probably in the spring out I have to like start,1
can't tell me how long you've been feeling down,1
six Ross okay tell me how many times you've felt this way in your life we've got periods of feeling down like how many of those,1
so I'm gonna ask you some different questions about what's going on or it could be going on do you feel like your mood is depressed most of the day nearly every day,1
you do here are feelings of hopelessness emptiness I'd like that a little bit okay two other people see you as being sad yeah do you feel like your interest in pleasurable activities has decreased mustard a nearly every day you still have some how about significant weight loss or weight gain,1
is that unusual for you have you had any difficulty sleeping too much too little,1
you feel like you're restless how about feeling of being slowed down any symptoms of feeling tired or losing energy coming fatigued,1
you feel that way how about inappropriate guilts or feelings of worthlessness,1
have you noticed it's been more difficult for you to concentrate or being more indecisive that's right now have you had recurrent thoughts of dying or committing suicide any suicide attempts,1
so I'm gonna ask you a few questions which ones resonate with you which of these items resonate with you that you're experiencing and which ones maybe don't apply okay do you feel like that your moods been depressed most of the day nearly every day like feelings of sadness hopelessness things like that,1
how about have you noticed a significant change in your interest in pleasurable activities most of the day nearly every day has your weight change significantly either losing weight or gaining weight,1
is that what kind of weight gain unusual for you how about having trouble sleeping too much or too little,1
I mean hours do you notice yourself either being more agitated or more slowed down in terms of your movements,1
well I wanted to talk to you about something we talked about earlier session which was a time it sound like a few months ago,1
well my sister questions about that that period of time in your town,1
well remember we talked before you said it was a time it sounded like a started about a year ago,1
we were kind of down like now you're you see my good little off,1
and you mentioned that you weren't sleeping too well do you have any weight changes during that time,1
so this symmetry which how you're feeling now sounds really opposite way you felt six months ago,1
can tell me about how the symptoms the presence of the symptoms like the frequency duration for example during that time period was that most of the day nearly every day that you felt this way did you have any trouble concentrating or making decisions,1
having a thoughts of suicide this is back this information is very helpful thanks Ian,1
good afternoon miss fish I would like to personally thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to talk to us regarding smoking cessation we're basically going to go through a few questions that will help both of us get a better understanding about your current smoking status and I'm going to just take some notes here as we continue to talk okay first of all how long has you have you been smoking and at what age did you begin to ,1
and in those  years had you ever trying to quit ,1
okay well that's fine I mean what you definitely deserve some applause for you know your willingness to quit in it as you know smoking is a very difficult habit to quit especially for a time I paid like  years so what were your reasons behind wanting to quit in those previous tips ,1
okay okay then and then what did your physician tell you about more of the specific dangers in continuing to smoke,1
he just said it was bad  okay so if I understand you correctly miss Fisher on you saying that you have been smoking for  years with several attempts to quit in the past but ultimately no long-term success okay both your mother and other family members along with your physician have told you several times on that you need to quit but neither of those individuals everyone into the overall specifics about the actual dangers of wanting to quit smoking is that does that sound about right yeah pretty much okay,1
okay so let's kind of take it one step forward um and those are tips to quit in the past what was it that you know made you start back smoking again ,1
okay okay then well that's that's quite all right in this fish I mean we have we have a multitude of patients that mentioned those particular reasons specifically right there also you know as you know I mean but I would say that we've had also great successes working with those patients and ultimately getting them to quit smoking so there's there isn't any lost hope with that so let's let's move into talking about your reasons for wanting to quit should you should you desire to do so what will be those reasons for wanting to quit if you decide to do so ,1
okay then get you through the day okay well well tell me this what was the longest period of time that you were able to quit in the past you know since you mentioned the previous quit attempts,1
okay why are you able to quit for nine months that's it that's it that's a pretty big accomplishment miss Fisher if you think about it that's pretty much close to in close to an entire year you know do you does that make sense that that's a pretty long period of time you know one whole year why don't you ,1
okay I mean and I can and I believe it's safe to say that was a pretty tough decision considering the fact that you've been smoking for  years right one okay and so basically the fact that you are willing to take it upon yourself in the meantime to quit while you're pregnant that speaks volumes of you you know so that would that would basically lead into my next question you on what would have been the worst thing that could have happened to you if you had quit me smoke if you have started to quit smoking for good after your pregnancy ,1
nothing bad okay okay what Mina in my opinion I believe you're you're exactly right no as you well know I mean the the the journey to quitting smoking is very difficult but if you think about it you yourself you were able to quit for almost a year now you were able to quit for nine months so just as you were able to quit during your pregnancy for the sake of the kids you know you can use that same sort of energy to want to have the desire to quit for the sake of your own health in order to see your kids grow up to be you know healthy individuals also okay and that's and that's really something to think about so I guess my next question for you miss Fisher would be more like a scenario question so if you can kind of roll with me on that on the scale of one to ten how important is it for you to consider thinking about quitting smoking sooner rather than later with one being not important at all or ten being the utmost and most important ,1
alright that's it and that's a great point that you bring out to me miss Fisher on I believe this gives us some some great foundation you know should we decide to move forward with this to with the smoking cessation if it's okay with you I would really like to schedule another interview with you or another point we can actually sit down and go into further detail about about these other barriers that people face on there when they're smoking and also share with you some of the great benefits that that can come of quitting smoking on would that be something that you would be interested in yeah okay well that would be great I mean I would like to thank you again for coming by and we can schedule you an appointment for advocate I was saying about one week does that work for you yeah time free okay and in the meantime I like to come and hand you this tobacco log right here this isn't it this isn't an attempt to help you quit rather it would help us identify some specific triggers and identify triggers that you may face along the road to quitting smoking okay well thank you very much and you have a good rest of the day okay nice meeting  ,1
well cast our walls I'm really glad that you were able to find some time to actually get get together,1
yeah that's right I know I was thrilled to see that you've made an appointment on my calendar and you know you have this benefit as a health coach and we've just never been able to find time to get together I know you're always running around helping someone someone or whoever I hear about that raving about pastor wall it's great help,1
that's happily so blonde glad that you took the time out to you know think a little bit about yourself and spend a little time that we could talk about how things are going for you you know you give a lot of your time to everyone else but it's also good for you too you have some balance and think about things for yourself also,1
so tell me about how things are going over overall I know you had mentioned in your email that you lost some weight recently,1
your wife's foot feeding you huh well I'm sure if you quit feeding you you would find some other great way to eat,1
so you thought you've really found that when you want to eat you both order wasn't one portion and share it,1
well what kind of exercise do you like to do I mean you probably get enough exercise just running around between folks,1
you do do you have to go for that early morning block block and monitor the neighborhood,1
then everyone's waving down pastor Walt with their,1
latest thing that they're not talk to you about oh good well if there was anything about your health you're still thinking about now in terms of you know what's your next goal or what your next step or something you're thinking about,1
so overall things seem to be going pretty special you are you,1
yeah so that's that's that's awesome it sounds like good a great place and sounds like the things you have implemented,1
well on this scale of one to ten you know like we use that pain scale with people as nurses how confident are you that you'll continue on with what you've been doing as far as the portions and though bike riding,1
so pretty confident that things will continue on it you can maintain what you've been doing and that's great you're not a zero,1
well what makes you a seven and not a four in terms of confidence,1
well because you've been doing it and you've been consistent and successful with it,1
and what would it take to make you be a nine in terms of being more confident that it'll happen all the time,1
so what I'm hearing you say is that's kind of what you're wanting to get to is being able to global add a little more to what your schedule is and how do you see yourself doing that,1
okay so of course the Florida whether you've got those hundred degree humid temperatures where you feel like you're hot then you get on the bike,1
island by the evening is it is it cool down some and we committed to taking off a little need me,1
huh so that it's kind of picking those days of window I feel like going out there do I feel like sweating right now on the bike,1
uh-huh so that seems kind of like your next focus on just trying to implement that,1
well it sounds like you know you're doing a lot to really think about your house and to have a balance between what you're offering to other people but also taking time for you do you do anything just do do anything just for you time just to you know be able to just have your own time to enjoy and mind,1
none of the fluffy Harlequins or whatever that the women like to watch read huh,1
leadership something that gives you some more tools to work with folks that have some depth to them well that sounds great if we could just perhaps maybe talking you know a couple maybe four to six weeks and kind of see how that bicycling is going for you and just know I'm here for you and,1
hi Michael it's good to see ya well glad you came in today when I douse up ,1
well I appreciate your bringing that up that is does sound frustrating but by coming in it gives us a chance to to sit down and and and talk and see how things are going with the medication which is what I'm most concerned about I know we started at about three months ago or so and I am real interested to hear how you're how you're doing on ,1
so kind of has taken the wind out of your sails ,1
how long have you noticed that oh I don't know I ,1
doesn't sound like it's working well too working too well for you have you tell me about how you're taking the medication have you taking it very regular ,1
okay so you've been pretty consistent and taken the ,1
anything else going on in terms of symptoms no just this overall lack of energy which I know my wife doesn't particularly care for,1
your wife  tell me a little bit more about how it affects the relationship between the two of you ,1
well as I say I get up and go got up and went and there's not much going on between the two of us like there used to be ,1
so sexual performance is not as good as it as it might be ,1
so does this sound like something that you want to continue or should we talk about possibly other other options for you it sounds like it's kind of affecting your life negatively,1
yeah so taking care of your blood pressure is is very important to you ,1
again it doesn't sound like this particular medicines working out too well for you if it's okay I could talk to you about possibly changing the medication so on the one hand we'd be keeping your blood pressure under control but on the other hand we wouldn't be causing these types of side effects hopefully would that be okay,1
yeah so uh I think probably it sounds to me like probably changing medications at this point as a start we can always add another medication later if that becomes necessary ,1
so you'd at least be willing to try a change and and see how that goes ,1
well if it's okay I can tell you about a group of medications that I I like but if but first if it's okay that they give you a kind of my rationale for using that medication to start with so you know one of the things you'd mentioned to me was some of the financial concerns and the medication that you're on is pretty dirt-cheap and for most people at this dose particularly a low dose because you have mild hypertension most of the time it doesn't have many side effects obviously for you that was different does that make sense,1
so the medication I'm thinking about is something called an ACE inhibitor ACE inhibitors are very very well tolerated and occasionally people will get a dry hacky cough with them but it's fairly rare but there's very low risk of side effects in terms of sexual side effects in particular and most people as a matter of fact it's one of the the drugs that actually helps your heart beat a little bit stronger and better and many people don't have any kind of a decrease in their energy so how does that sound,1
okay so what other things can you tell me about that might affect your blood pressure ,1
yeah and if it's okay I'm going to write down some of these things that as we talk through them so what else can affect blood pressure that you know of,1
well sometimes sometimes weight can be an issue and explain this little tool to you this is for what it's worth called a agenda mapping so it sounds like there's a number of things that you know of and then we can talk about that affect your blood pressure you mentioned stress and an alcohol and we talked about weight certainly you know blood pressure medication can affect you there and I would say another big one might be exercise does all that makes sense ,1
so we could we can talk about a lot of these things with which one might you want to talk about and if we need to we can set up for appointment and talk about this more if we run out of time but ,1
tellme about the exercise that you're doing well I play golf and walk the golf course so you carry your bag or do ,1
it is exercise it is exercise Michael look at your your weight when we came in yeah and you were about  or so yeah which is actually according to your BMI body mass index in the in the overweight range how do you feel about that ,1
yeah you don't look terribly overweight but according to the the charts there it's in the overweight category so you're actually getting you into the normal category would be about a loss of about  to  pounds ,1
I understand I understand but you know I'm not saying that we need to lose  pounds sometimes just a loss of  pounds can make a tremendous impact on your on your blood pressure okay so  pounds sounds like something that might be negotiable ,1
is the number okay let's go you do with thigh okay I think I can do  all right so if you were to want to lose  pounds how would you go about it ,1
and that would actually kind of take care of two of these things right your weight and your exercise both of those would have a really positive effect I think on your on your blood pressure ,1
sowe've talked about changing your medication stopping the medication you're on changing you to this ACE inhibitor and then perhaps looking at the weight and going getting back to the gym and starting an exercise program is that about right ,1
I I really wonder if you would I think that's an excellent question and if you're motivated to lose that kind of weight I'm with you I can't leave I this good ,1
it may it may take more than five pounds to get the desired effect on your blood pressure that's really getting back down into that normal weight range if you will in that one  to  range probably,1
I don't think I'm ready to go there yet Michael but it sounds to me like you want to get off of your medication ,1
well itthere it's a blood pressure rate that you are right now blood pressure number that you are right now I probably wouldn't recommend that that that's going to take a plan for us to work out over probably a period of months so that you could one lose a little bit more weight to exercise really regularly we might want to talk about the alcohol um can I ask you how much your you're drinking now our regular basis ,1
two or three yeah it is okay I'd like to share with you a little bit of information about alcohol and its effect on blood pressure Merryn research has shown that for men more than two drinks a day and for what more than one drink a day really can significantly impact your blood pressure negatively it raises blood pressure how does that how does that sit with you,1
you'll do two okay and you said that you did two three every day most every day yeah sometimes a little more on the weekend I guess ,1
can youthink of any ways to maybe cut back on that to where you wouldn't be getting as much alcohol in your system on a regular basis ,1
so two a day um keep in mind too there are significant amounts of calories involved and alcohol particularly beer ,1
scale of zero to ten zero being not willing at all to do that ten being very willing to do that where do you think you ,1
tell me the good things about cutting back on alcohol and maybe switching to light beer talking about the good things well I did you know ,1
on ascale of zero to ten zero being not very important and ten being very important how important is it for you to to get better control of your blood pressure,1
so interms of making a change what are some of the things that you'd be willing to do in order to make that happen,1
okay so to recap changing your medication you're willing to go to the gym and exercise switch to light beer and keep the beer to a maximum of two a day okay now only you can make that decision Michael I can't do it for you is that somewhere that you're willing to go,1
so one more scale in terms of your readiness to make to do this zero being not ready at all and ten being ready where would you fall on that ,1
six and a half and watch six and a happen and not two or three,1
so you're really worried again about the health consequences of not keeping your blood pressure under control,1
that so if it's okay I'm going to put this in your record that we talked about well we're certainly going to switch your medication but you're going to be working on losing some weight going back to the gym cutting down on your beer usage and switching to light beer is there anything I missed ,1
fivepounds that's the number now I'd like to see you back and about let's call it a month let's see back in a month,1
pounds will be gone and we'll see how things are going and probably talk about this some more and see how successful you've been with this plan and then we'll go from there  ,1
we'll there's some things that have come up in in what I've seen so far I I just want to talk to you about your blood pressure it looks higher than I'd like and and obviously that concerns because there are some things that can happen with high blood pressure and I got to point out that the smoking in combination with the blood pressure concerns me and there may very well be cause and effect I'm sure the last thing you need is is somebody to to nag you but could we talk a bit about your smoking,1
okay so about half your life you've been a regular smoker,1
okay okay the most important thing I mean I've got slides will and statistics and all kinds of scary things I can say but the most important thing from my perspective is what your thoughts are about your smoking where you at with being a cigarette smoker,1
yeah and you know I know it's it's you know the cost and have gotten increase in over the last few years with with the cigarettes but uh but like I said at this point in time in my life I have a trouble seeing myself quit I'm a little bit concerned about you know I've had friends who tried to quit as well some successful some haven't been as successful ones that you know have quit they've noticed they've gained a lot of weight and and that's kind of concerns me in my age ranges what kind okay so you're doing a lot of good thinking well what what I heard you say and clearly you're a guy who sought through some things about your health what I heard you say smoking has some negative consequences and I don't want those things to happen but today's not the day I'm not gonna sign up and say today all all quit cold-turkey right you know appreciate that I would like to know will more about what you know about potential negative consequences when you think about what happens to smokers even half a pack a day what consequences are we concerned about,1
yeah yeah it's our that the the social pressure is a rough,1
so these real big health problems some of which your grandpa has emphysema certainly lung cancer another risk that people take and then you look at what's going on in your own health already a little short of breath sometimes not having the lung capacity that you'd like to have social pressure exposing your wife you know I I wish I could say that's not a word but I think you're doing some good thinking I do think part of why all this hassle about smoking publicly has happened is because if your wife's exposed certainly it's the two of you had children if your children were exposed there are some real health consequences to people who are around you when you're smoking and already some some sense of some symptoms you've had with so it's you're breathing all right are there any other you mentioned breathing and people's negative reactions your fear for your wife's health are there any other things that I should understand that you don't like about being a smoker other concerns,1
okay so so when you weigh things you just say man I'm concerned about weight gain this trick I know the gum didn't seem so great what else do you know we'll about sort of small steps people could take who don't want to get emphysema or lung cancer or have this thing progressed are there any small step you're telling me you're not really quit cold-turkey,1
well you've taken an important step will one of the first things I say to people who say I can't stop cold turkey is could you consider cutting back that's a huge step that is significant it's not perfect but I'm not in the business of perfect patience will I'm in the business of people taking small steps and this is this is a big one and I want to congratulate you I do know some things about other steps will and and even it sounds like quit cold-turkey isn't a step today but I do know some other options some other options to lay out potentially would it be ok if you and I talked about those other options that you could just file away for when you're ready,1
why miss Clark my name is Alan Lyme I'm a social worker at the Family Health Center ,1
I'm really glad that you here I'm just curious as to why he would send you to me ,1
yeah so he he actually see me because he went to him for increased stress and he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase and prior to prescribing you anything you want to make sure that you had someone to talk to about that,1
okay thank you so you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well um and that you have one or two drinks in one setting typically yeah and maybe monthly you have more than that what what's what kind of drinks do you have what do you drink we need to drive ,1
so starting to increase this times drink a little more okay well based on what you put here you give it gives you six points on this scale scale ranges from zero to forty so six points will put you in what we consider an at-risk zone so if it's okay with you lots to talk a bit about that okay okay so that was sunset run zero to forty it's not it's not a super high risk but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress maybe some physical Emmas related to alcohol well could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there or you can stay there this is a typical standard drink size over here I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine a lot ,1
yeah maybe the little space that it's upside to drink drink and a half each one so that also increased a little bit more so perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here and for women you healthy woman your age no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be lower or no-risk and / in one week so in total how much total in the week and what you say here is that even on this sheet you're perhaps already drinking more than that mmm,1
yeah it seems it seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking with what you consider to be healthy drinking and certainly there's this conflicting information out there about what's healthy what's not healthy imagine the increased stresses what because we're concerned or to seal as your stresses increases and if you were to prescribe you anything maybe some interaction between the two but also build and serve them I would think so if you would what is it that you like about alcohol ,1
so you like the taste of it mm-hmm and it does help to lower the stress signal which is for that time you're drinking one of those not so good things about alcohol for you ,1
so your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking ,1
so the one hand it lowers it on the other hand it's increasing kind of a seesaw teeter-totter effect then what do you make of that give them that on one hand it lowers and the other had it increases and now it's increasing even more ,1
yeah imagine you've had some thoughts of that what have you thought of trying well I've exercised in the past and that helps right now my schedule is kind of out of whack and I just really don't know what to do that's why I came to see dr. Steele,1
I'm just imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink on the level that you are drinking that whatever he prescribes you there may be an interaction with the to imagine that she's concerned I'm not completely sure so you've had some success in the past with changing behaviors and if you were to decide to make any changes here it sounds like you could drop all that to make those changes how important would it be for you on a scale of  through  i below the visual here with that if zero is not important ten is very important to do something about your drinking ,1
mm-hmm let's put it up there why do you choose a  or a  or  ,1
so you know all those responsibilities there's a lot riding on your decision in what to do this what if anything will bring up too late online on that scale,1
yeah so so you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it and if lo and your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do right now how confident are you that you could do something about your drinking ,1
okay so it's pretty hot up there again and what if what if anything would you choose to do would be to cut down with a bit to quit,1
so you'd be willing to stop altogether that's what was indicated by the physician okay so so based on that how ready are you to do anything right now whether it's to cut back whether it is to quit ,1
it sounds is that you'll be pretty motivated to do something about this right now given your responsibilities given your children relying at this point and just on on lowering anxiety in general it sounds and that's one of your goals as well well I'm pretty confident that once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do you'll be able to follow through that based on your experience in the past of of making behavior changes imagine some things that you can draw upon what's one thing that you could do imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress ,1
one of the things we can't offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this there's a terrible stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make a point for you if you like before you leave today dad talk to someone that'd be nice right it also has some information here if you're interested some a pamphlet on alcohol and and how what healthy limits are and how it may be affected by medications that you took as well and I wish you lots of luck it sounds as though you really committed to making this shift in this change and imagined doctors still wanna fight with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks again I look forward to speaking to in the future all right thank you very much you're welcome  ,1
good to meet you and I hear that you met with dr. Johnson and you were looking at your concerns about wage is that right,1
it sounds like you've been working at it but this the years go by it gets pretty pretty frustrating,1
and and how um is your weight affecting life for you what's life like sort of where you are,1
so as the years have gone by it's it's it's becoming more and more of a problem,1
yeah yeah okay and any other sense of how it's affecting the pain course is a very noticeable you know subject but anything else that you experience,1
and you're in you know that if you lost some weight that then you'd have less pressure on those knees in you can be you,1
yeah well it sounds as though you feel pretty strongly about this that you've been your back in here really wanting us to help you get something going,1
so first off I have to hear a ruler rubens and if if you might indicate if you wish from a scale of 0 to 10 just how strong your conviction is about this being a problem you know just as you're describing it the pain and the concerns about your cardiovascular you know all of the ways that it's affecting your life okay from zero that it's really not that much of a problem to 10 this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed,1
and on what what do you think your mind is you know what the concerns are that your mind has are the are any doubts or anything,1
yeah absolutely um and nine so that's really quite high too,1
attends the top of the scale with your body but nine with you not just your thoughts and feelings about it so what makes it a night and not a seven or an eight,1
yeah that sounds like that's a source of frustration,1
yeah yeah if I could share a perspective that i have about giving what goes on with our mind and our body you'd be interested,1
well and this is just my theory but I really has a sense that you know we've got an appetite center in their brain right I'm part of our brain that regulates it might be getting messages about how much energy we have available probably a lot of other things too but basically that's monitoring our body to make sure that we're getting enough nutrition I think one of the challenges as we gradually gained weight and that's what happens with a lot of us know is that over time we gradually gain weight and then we look and we say well this is you know 10 15 20 pounds more than I want to be now but up here okay this this Center in the brain is doing its job of maintaining all those new cells okay you know it's going you know our job two days make sure that everybody gets fed and so we're working against something that's quite automatic in there you know the appetite that we have you know the appetite that we have when we have carb cravings you know I my sense of it is is that that's just something very very automatic Amanda but I also know that it's possible for us to especially someone with a strong conviction that you're demonstrating you know to to really start making some changes so maybe we'll explore for a moment if you like some of the things that you've tried and maybe your sense of what some of the things you you know might might like us to look into it now,1
yeah absolutely and then even just the factor that the apnea causes you to feel very tired during the day,1
yeah you don't have that energy to beginning of the doing things,1
if you're interested a book that i read a while back called why french women don't get fat,1
and our goal isn't to be like french women but there are some things in in the in the diet in or lifestyle in that country that are different than the lifestyle in the united states and seem to contribute to better fitness and not quite so much overweight in the book she is a high school student exchange student going to the US and she encountered chocolate chip cookies and brownies and things could put a lot of weight on her and the amount of time look what just happened that must be must be youtube doing that I've all guys folks um and when she got back to the to France she'd gained a lot of weight went to her family doctor and he suggested that that's the first step getting that making a food log,1
and then the perspective that he used was was to just find what he called the offenders we'd like one or two things that oh hi you know concentrated Swedes or concentrated fat and I see a not happening here then what what comes up driver when it I,1
yeah ice cream I think pretty much is at the top of the list for all of us you know I swear that ice cream when I have it it just goes right to my hips you know it doesn't pass go doesn't go like two hundred dollars it just goes right there so have you had you looked into that as a possibility if so i might try to cut back,1
mmm yeah I think it's really got that reward circuit in our brain down yeah yeah yeah yeah well is that something you'd like to cut back on,1
ill so you'd like to be I love I got ice cream okay,1
only you're thinking not getting into the house,1
haha not come thank you a very good idea you are not shutting down will not let this happen I've already been with apple support it looks like YouTube needs a talking okay so ice cream is the goal,1
all right and in what would you say your your specific goal would be about ice cream that you really like to not have it in the house is that your main thing or,1
yeah and that's so easy to do because it's not filling you know and you know we it turns to liquid in our stomach to everybody,1
oh absolutely yeah that is one of the strategies I used once I just have a little in the morning and burn it off you know and all that's doing is lighting that fire in there I don't know something ya,1
and how confident would you say you feel and again we're going to go back to as if you roll the clock 0 to 10 0 and 0 is you don't feel at all confident and 10 as you feel completely confident that you will be able to make this change if not having ice cream in the house and maybe we'll say Joanna for the time of you know an estimate of help for how long,1
yeah it's funny when I think it's hannaford here in Calais the ice cream is over that way and the produce is over the head okay no it's like making a right turn instead of a left turn,1
yeah it's the right and it's the right way you go yeah young you could have a cup am i right yeah all right thank you let's take the right turn out of the right right whatever nothing yet,1
so why would you put your confidence 0 to 10 and i'll let you make a mark to feel like,1
and that brings up an idea I might be able to help you with maybe next time we meet if you like,1
and that is of course we'll check in and see how it was not going fun also there's a process called thought mapping that's a method where you walk yourself through step by step going into the store how you're feeling anything to do with feelings about ice cream and and you can rehearse in your own mind,1
making the right turn instead of the wrong turn,1
yes exactly and part of that yeah the way that they visualize they want to do that I left then I hi pole vault oh and they by picturing themselves doing it they actively Prix the performance improves,1
so we might we might plan that or it sounds like you kind of got a sense of how it works,1
yeah yeah it's a little bit of a but if if you already it sounds like you've already got a sense of how visualization works on and you might be able to just decide say I mean what it makes sense to you even as you're young either in the car about to get it go into the store that you're visualizing yourself or maybe at home before you go out you know whatever makes sense to you you could even experiment a bit on your own,1
it works yeah yeah and visualizing now so I'm ever visualizing the fruit you know and having kinds that you really like you know and if you like variety you know one make it as enjoyable as possible but you are so wise to come up with that idea of substituting something you know putting having something else in place of because when we just take something away something else in the brain goes 0 or you're taking my you know it didn't,1
I'm going to have this instead this is much better,1
and I should check the time for measures when we are I get 15 minutes,1
we are on not seeing oh yes we are i think we can stop ok so i will look forward to seeing you in a couple weeks and,1
hi Alex my name is Tony I'll be your nurse for today how are you doing,1
okay tell me a little bit more about this firefight,1
okay from what I'm getting here is you were intoxicated at that point in time and then you had a confrontation with this girl which led to the bar fight and,1
okay so it seems that you can't offend that they feel offended you refer to me,1
over yeah all right of all we do have some time right now if it's okay with you I wonder if we could talk a little bit about your drinking habits,1
I do you what is drinking you for you would have,1
okay so to me this is our drinking is your way of relaxing with your friends is your way to socialize and it breaks that I guess right it helps you socialize and you know I'm I also wanted to say that experience I was responsible of you to be drinking and not driving,1
so for my understanding drinking it helps you socialize his friends it relaxes you it's you know here we have just you know it breaks that ice for you on the other hand it's causing that a lot of arguments of do you and your significant other Henry,1
and it's causing a lot that that all those arguments are completed you a lot of stress in your relationship this manager,1
this seems like a little Brady lucky died to have someone who loved him that much,1
so what I'm getting here right now is that if you just want to quit,1
yeah and it's just partly because um but this alcohol is the leading to the arguments with Henry and it's necessary relationship,1
I noticed over a year there and I know you don't really like like the idea of it but what do you know about it eh like what's one shift of light on that,1
mm-hmm well you're right there for multiple walks of life and they share their drinking stories and everyone just kind of helps each other through this journey if you can so prayer together,1
I don't even want to join eight at this point in time,1
mom's but hypothetically speaking would you ever consider joining it,1
mm-hmm okay well on a scale of 1 to 10 I'm 10 mean like for sure and 1 being not really sure about it at all what would you say where you are on the scale with 20 an 80-acre know that you,1
why would you say sticks instead of say that's really I mean you're really adamant about not doing anything,1
yeah so right now we're sitting at a six what needs to happen stated maybe we can jump that to an eight or nine,1
yeah all of these are like really understand aborning it's just of course you want something I mean you need to be close to use you don't have to commute so far and,1
the fish is very busy sniffle and Emily makes sense and of course the environment I mean if you're not happy they're just an even and learning and if you're not comfortable in it and it's very hard for you to,1
well actually today I was wondering if it's a great view I can give you this for sure it's just for any medium you're really close to your location where you live,1
and my number is also on then you can always give me a call if you have any concerns and also I just want to thank you today for sharing your stage of drinking and I know it's not you know easy to just tell me no this is a very sensitive subject down so I want to,1
they're very welcome and if it's okay with you perhaps maybe we can schedule another follow-up meeting I'll tell you about like two weeks or so,1
my name is Jessamine all knobbly and I will be leading you through our nutrition and education and counselling meeting today,1
just a little bit about myself I am a Nutrition and Dietetics student at Loma Linda University and we'll be sitting for my Rd exam next June,1
so I just want tell you know I got into this field because I just really wanted to enhance and improve people's health through making advantageous dietary choices so,1
before we get started would you like a bottle of water,1
yes go for it so in today's session I would just like to hear about some of your personal goals why you came to the session today obstacles you may be facing in regards to nutrition and just figure out some ways to overcome challenges that you may be facing,1
okay so for you I just threw a lot at me so I'd like to go back and recap some of the things that you were saying to make sure that I'm understanding everything clearly,1
so in January 2010 you started a meal plan that was very strict and you were able to maintain it for a few years,1
few months yes you think a few months and then you started to travel and you know kind of things kind of went a little bit astray from there,1
you went from this strict dieting all-or-nothing kind of plan do not really knowing how to make food for yourself or compose a meal for yourself because you were,1
so you almost kind of missed out on the education portion of how to eat when you're on your own,1
which is what in the long term we want to achieve is for you to be able to make healthy food choices when someone isn't there to tell you what to do you're able to critically think for yourself and regardless the nutrition,1
so some other things that you mentioned was that you're just feeling frustrated and kind of out of control in regards to your weight-loss initiatives which I can which is very it seems very frustrating if you want to be losing weight and you're not not seeing it and then you said that you were tend to be eating more so those are all very frustrating things and not and then you also said that during your day you're not really eating consistently,1
you're kind of all over the place and kind of looking for more of you know consistent meal plan day in which you're not you know starving and then overeating later,1
let's talk about where you get most of your meals from,1
okay um so I'm hearing that you get most of your meals from outside of the home,1
and not typically cooking meals and kind of go for those more convenience convenience meals that's easy yes so how would you feel about going over some tips for when you're dining out that if that's if you're very busy and like that's the option that you're doing right now I'm just making some little tweaks because cooking at home may not be an option for you at this moment,1
yes are some some tips that you can implement when you're at the restaurant,1
so some of the things that I would like to talk about so when you're ordering food from a restaurant you want to stay away from words such as like fried or just like also deep fried and kind of go for those words like royal bake and steam,1
so recently you told me that you went to a restaurant and I have the menu printed out here and I would give you a copy of that,1
and and you told me that you ordered the New York strip steak,1
so just looking at the options here we do have a fresh fish option at the top,1
and it says it's simply grilled with olive oil or you could get it pan-seared baked or blackened with lemon shallot butter,1
so I would probably say maybe to stay away from the lemon shallot butter noise and maybe steer towards that simply grilled with olive oil or the maybe the baked or,1
you could do the pan serve but the other ones are better option,1
so going for those terms and maybe doing like maybe a fish option every once in a while as opposed to doing a steak,1
okay some other tips so when you're ordering if you want to order a salad instead of ordering the salad and getting kind of like a Caesar dressing or something like that they typically kind of put a lot of dressing on salads so maybe ordering it on the side is a better option because then you can be in control of how much you would like to add on to the salad,1
and typically going for maybe like a balsamic dressing is good or you could do a balsamic and olive oil dressing,1
typically most restaurants will have that option,1
so also in regards to restaurants portion sizes are typically very large and you had mentioned earlier that you know sometimes you just don't know when to stop eating or you tip you think you're hungrier than you are you just eat a lot at once,1
so a good tip is to kind of ask for a to-go box in the beginning when you get to the restaurant,1
after your meal comes and just put half of the food in the box and you don't open the box can't get home it's kind of bang for your buck too right because then you can either other real later,1
and you could if you do choose a healthy option you can take it to work the next day and you'll have a lunch option for you here at the office,1
um also when it comes to salads you really don't so here they have the chopped spinach salad for example there's bacon egg radishes mushrooms and warm bacon dressing just because a menu item has all these things included does not mean that you have to get it with all those things in it,1
so you can easily tell them oh can I have the chopped chicken it's chopped spinner salad without the bacon,1
so that is something that you could ask for for that side because I mean spinach is great mushrooms are great radishes are great egg is great you can always take out egg whites I mean the egg yolk if you don't want the egg yolk or anything like that so a lot of restaurants I think analogies are accommodating because they want to have your certainty they want to have your business,1
so they're gonna try their best to make the customer happy,1
so for me personally I often ask for changes in my in my orders unless they specifically specified please do not make changes on to the order or we can't make a change for this order I typically change majority of my orders,1
because the foods that you eat or the foods that are commercially made are not necessarily the healthiest,1
so they usually have lots of fat and you know sugar and sodium and those kinds of things added to it to appeal to a wider variety of individuals,1
I have a little handout here so we can talk about some like portion sizes,1
so a fist would be considered like a cup of rice or pasta or fruits or vegetables it's about the size of your fist is one serving,1
yes good right the palm of your hand is about three ounces so that would be for fish meat or poultry that's about the size some people say like a deck of cards it's about 4 ounces,1
it's around there and then if you're gonna have nuts of reasons a handful is about 1 ounce there's like a little handful so one thumb would be one ounce of hard cheese or peanut butter and you said,1
and then for your thumb is a a teaspoon of our thumb tip is a tea spoon of cooking oil or margarine or butter and sugar,1
as a teaspoon why don't you try and start setting some goals for you in regards to some food we do,1
yeah so would you um what a goal be that you want to choose grilled options,1
what you mean okay are you willing to do that choose grilled options,1
okay so that seems like something that we could,1
okay so um how many of these a week would you say you could draw,1
okay so why don't you give a range of times so why don't we say four to seven times a week in the mornings for we can say until our next session so we can go you can go back and recap how the journaling is going for you,1
generally how you're feeling physically maybe the food reflect on the food choices that you had made the day before maybe set some you said you like setting little objectives maybe little mini goals for yourself for the day things like that,1
okay that's great so why don't we just make sure we're doing that let's say seventy-five percent of the time you're eating out,1
what I do we try and good ideas living by kind of like an 8020 percent rule so eighty percent of the time you're making healthy choices twenty percent of the time you can kind of you know feel like you're not as restricted because it seemed like in the past being on a very strict diet doesn't work in the long run because that's not how life works,1
and things are thrown at you and you have to be a little bit valuable to your different situation,1
so those are some good goals now I would like to talk a little bit maybe up some physical activity,1
yes so I'm understand that you do want to become more physically active and you've had experience in the past being physically active what do you feel has prevented you from from being physically active is it time is it being tired,1
okay you know what kinds of physical activity do you enjoy doing if you were to do physical activity what do you like doing,1
you start that's difficult he's very different getting there,1
okay so um okay so starting is difficult but just remember that any little changes you're making are are good even if it's going to the gym for just a little bit in 20 or 15 20 minutes or just walking outside of your house and you know after work or in the morning around the lunch break just going outside getting some fresh air how do you feel about maybe parking further,1
so maybe we'd like to set a goal for that so what about well what what seems good for you how often do you want to do it every time,1
so even that alone will give you a little bit more,1
exercise so maybe parking I don't know an exact distance but parking further away if you're going to the grocery store if you're going in and out of places just walking more in general,1
typically once you start something you kind of like and start seeing results,1
okay so then something to remember is that results don't come overnight and that's hard,1
to have to stick to something and constantly remembering that and maybe that's something you could write about in your journaling too I'm saying that results literally writing results don't happen overnight,1
because if you do stick to a plan over time you will see results yes we exciting for you,1
I'm the greatest so maybe getting up in the morning and going on the treadmill how often would you be willing to do that sure we,1
four times a week so for how long do you think you can even go on,1
do you think that would be realistic for your schedule and now that we're saying that we're gonna be journal,1
okay so why don't we start trying with 20 minutes,1
so for 15 or 10 minutes or 50 Matt what works best for your schedule,1
mm-hmm and over time it will help but you also have to couple it with your with I don't is,1
yeah it's going through the motions so yeah well it becomes kind of second nature,1
they say it takes about like 27 or 30 somewhere around their days to develop a habit,1
I'll have to get you the exact number later but yeah so for it to start feeling second nature so it seems like you are really you want to make you're you're preparing to make the changes right so,1
you know you know that you want to make the changes and you feel ready to make you feel ready to make these changes,1
that's like me to drinking water for me is a struggle and I have to make myself do it but I know that I'll feel rejuvenated and I'll my body will function better and let my metabolic processes happen like they should and get my food and digestive system going so they're very I mean we're made up of mostly water so your thought you brought he needs that,1
and just keeps you more alert when you're dehydrated do typically more sluggish and you're less more likely to make poor nutrition decisions,1
so just drinking water so why don't we you said you've done it in the past right how do you feel about drinking five bottles,1
so you know it's really cool as they have apps now,1
that you can track how much water you're drinking I'll have to drop,1
mmm-hmm yeah and you can track how much water you're drinking out of there and there's other web sites or apps like MyFitnessPal that you can track what you're eating and it will track all the calories and things like that for your day so why don't we go over um why don't we recap some of the goals so I just wanted me to say your understanding you know what we went through and some things that we talked about,1
yes you should be noting some goals for the rest of the day so I want to drink five remember to drink five bottles of water,1
things like that just was kind of like reminders for yourself,1
well I also want to reiterate that it's you know there's no good food and bad food right there's no such thing as good food bad food that's when we we come to pick like portion sizes right,1
but we want to have more you know plant-based foods and we meats and low-fat dairy and whole grains and things like that,1
and fruits and things because of all the health benefits that they have,1
and then we want to you know for sweets and other other treats and desserts we want to keep them as treats and desserts and by doing by keeping a portion the size small we can also you know continue our goal of weight loss,1
because we don't want to you know deprive you and then all of a sudden oh I want to binge eat all this food,1
so and you know there's you know events and parties and things like that that you kind of need to be you know okay with you know living a little bit,1
I don't remember the exact timeframe but it's somewhere around there,1
maybe keep it as a goal just to get there just to get to that,1
well it will have to be helpful with water I mean it will result in water weight loss but that's not really fat loss so that removes water weight will come back when you drink a bunch of water again so that's not really the weight loss were looking for we want fat loss,1
you want a decrease in fat and increase in lean mass,1
hi gene I'm dr. sabe nice to meet how can I help you today ,1
something okay so you've been diagnosed by this progress brother just diagnosed that and and how are you feeling right now ,1
it sounds like you've been smoking for such a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you and now that's really causing you to be afraid and frightened ,1
no have you thought about when you want to quit,1
okay so what I'm hearing you say is that although you want to quit smoking in the next six months you're feeling a bit under confident that you'll actually be able to do this and your word about failing ,1
so you've been able to quit smoking but only when you were in the hospital ,1
let me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with this could you tell me what is good about smoking for you,1
so gene I want to make sure that I understood what you've told me of what do you find good about smoking so it helps you calm down it gives you something to do it's been part of your image you feel sophisticated you feel like a movie star in fact the way you talk about it seems like that's what it makes you feel like is that right that's right okay is there anything I missed,1
so it's hard for you to quit smoking when everybody else around you're smoking and it's so easy to go and take a break and have a cigarette,1
you've told me what is good about smoking for you ah can you tell me what it's not so good about smoking for you ,1
is there anything else that's not good abouts looking for you ,1
okay so let me make sure I've understood this piece as well so they're not good things on the not so good things about smoking for you are the effects on your health the effects on your physical appearance on how you look and the amount of investment that you do making in makeup and in getting your nails done etc and then the cost of smoking yes so so let me ask you this given everything going on in your life right now on a scale of  to  where  is the most important thing to do and one would be the least important thing to do how important is it for you to quit smoking ,1
let me ask another question and follow-up to that again given everything going on where  is the most confident you ever felt about anything and one is the least confident how confident are you that you will be able to quit ,1
okay now help me understand why you said  and not something like  or  because you mentioned that you don't even want to quit ,1
so you've said  to  percent what would it take to build that confidence to about % ,1
so if you got help that would help you say that you went from % to % ,1
so Jean I really want to congratulate you on taking this very important for a step towards addressing this problem that you've had for such a long time but as the first small step I wonder whether you'd be open to actually just monitoring your smoking for the next week and the reason why I say that is because as you were mentioning to me smoking is so automatic for you that sometimes writing it down helps make every cigarette a conscious act and I notice that you were saying to me you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes and sometimes just being mindful and writing something down will help you get some control over what you're doing and that's often the first small step what are your thoughts about that,1
that's correct and writing it down helps that process,1
okay and I can give you a little card that can help you keep track of it and then if you can bring that back to the next appointment it could be something we could discuss okay anything else ,1
excellent well thank you so much for coming in today and thank you for seeing me doctor you're welcome  ,1
hi Josh great to see you how's everything going with you,1
great okay so before we get started are there any changes to your medical history such as any new medications you might be taking or any serious operation since the last time I saw you,1
okay so what would you like me to do for you today would you like me to simply do a check-up let you know what I find and perhaps help you have a healthy mouth,1
sure okay let's lie you back very some became one of your lower molars unfortunately Josh it does look like you're going to need a feeling I would like to try to help you so we can determine just how you got this new hole may I ask you a few questions so we can avoid it from happening in the future,1
it sounds like you're keen to get healthy I like your practical attitude the new filling will fix this hole but it won't stop new holes from occurring as I said I really would like to try to help you so we can avoid you having to get any fillings in the future on that note would be really great to try to get to know what you've been eating and drinking,1
you obviously know yourself pretty well thanks for these helpful information,1
you're right that it's bad for your teeth should I possibly give you any more information,1
the bacteria actually use the sugar that's in your mouth to create acids and it's these acids that eat through the tooth surfaces to cause holes so you could say the more the teeth are coated in sugar the more likely it is that you're going to get holes if we're able to chat a little bit more about your diet I might be able to help you so that we can reduce the risk of you needing fillings in the future,1
okay it sounds like you're not ready to chat about this today is that okay with you if we have this conversation at some point in the future,1
okay great I'll make sure I make a note in your file and then if it's okay with you next time you come in we won't be able to pick up where we left off today you've got a lot in your mind and I don't really want to overwhelm you some people actually like to jot down the sorts of things they've been eating and drinking and bring it into the next visit or have actually seen some really great apps on smart phones where you can record this sort of information really easily it's up to you of course I'll leave it to you to think about you,1
there's great seeing you thank you for coming to diabetes clinic today my name is Mark Smith I'm a pharmacist I work with dr. Pham and I we run the diabetes clinic and we basically serve to educate our patients so that I can better manage their their diabetes and looking at your chart I see that you are pre-diabetic so what we're going to do now is kind of focus on nutrition mostly diet and exercise okay,1
okay okay that's fine I'm glad you had the opportunity to talk with the nutritionist I'm she's a very nice lady and she has some very valuable information do you mind telling me some of the things that she discuss with you,1
okay well I will show you what I normally go through with my patients and then you can let me know if there's any information that you covered with the nutritionist or any of the material it's new to you then that would be great as well basically we feel that going over the nutrition aspect of diabetes and pre-diabetes is so important there's so much that we can do without taking medications and we've seen many patients that have benefited from making just minor changes to their diet that are greatly impacted their health in a very positive way so to start off I'm just going to ask you a few questions about what you eat to get a better picture of your diet so first what did you have for breakfast,1
okay spaghetti salad and bread okay so tell me then what about any snacking that you do throughout the day like any snacks or anything like that,1
okay and also what kind of beverages and things that you drink what are some of the things that you drink throughout throughout your day,1
okay okay well thanks for sharing a bit of information within this patient this kind of gives us a better idea of what you throughout the day so now I'm going to give you some information or show you some information about nutrition okay,1
okay all right so that's that's that's my ministrations but just just kind of bear with me so when I gather from your best far as that you know already you're fully aware of the things that you need to do in order to live a healthy lifestyle and take care of yourself however you seem to find it difficult and you don't think that it works for you is that that's kind of the fish that I'm getting so explain to me what are some of the barriers that you feel exists that prevents you from eating healthier and losing weight,1
okay okay then I understand completely that finances can be a potential issue and an issue especially when it comes to eating healthy more importantly picking out the right healthy foods for your kids to end and also to have good taste is also a priority to you so tell me about you know we're going to switch and transition from diet and talk about exercise tell me about your normal exercise routine,1
okay okay and then what are some of the barriers you believe that prevent you from exercising on a regular basis,1
all right and then what what ultimate benefits let's talk about benefits what benefits that you feel that you can ultimately gain by by seeking out more nutritious foods and incorporating exercise into a daily regimen regimen and an overall losing weight what do you think would be the benefits of doing all that,1
okay maybe yes yes ma'am well and and then those things are exactly correct on what I would like to do miss Fisher I know that you're pressed for time I'm not going to take too much of your time but I would like to schedule min and I and basically sit down with you and kind of go over some some helpful alternatives and basically look at some cost effective type thing since cost is an issue with you and then also look at some resources that we can channel into when it comes to exercise you'll soon find out that some of the exercises that you can do they don't even require a gym membership so you know if that's something deal at because you mentioned to me that time and money are contouring for you so we basically want to work with you together to see if we can get something that that better suits you you know and get you on the right track when it comes to your pre-diabetes and overall losing weight so would you like to come in and scheduling Pullman with us about a week from now,1
yes ma'am yes ma'am I believe that so what what we do is we'll schedule a week from now and but it was it was a pleasure talking with you and I very much look forward to working with you okay all right yeah we good rest of the day okay all right,1
that's nice so hearing me say is that you're stressed with all this going on at school and preparing for the holidays that's that big it's really a lot on your plate,1
so do you feel like you but obviously we're this far on this semester how well do you think you've done well thus far,1
do you think if you do what are some options that you see you may have preparing yourself to get the assignments done,1
have you tried anything that might have works in past -,1
it's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies,1
so you put a lot of pressure on yourself when I hear saying it's cool because you like that -,1
do you feel like you've done involve thus far the semester your classes,1
so your primary concern really is for the speak you have to get done this week I remember me just said earlier about creating possibly the creating the to-do list or do you think do you think those things that you mentioned earlier would be good,1
completion with that and going the holiday do you feel like when you do how do you feel stressful week,1
so it seems like you have a lot going on this week but you seem motivated and now to complete it and you have the break to look forward to but you said it so that sounds like you you're almost there you're going to make it so it's good hearing from you [Music],1
so what I hear you saying is that you're feeling really stressed and kind of stretched out too thin,1
that sounds exhausting so it sounds like you're feeling this contradiction of pleasing your dad and meeting his expectations but you also want to enjoy yourself and be young is that right,1
so that must be really frightening to be so confused about your dad's expectations and I also imagine you feel pretty frustrated with them yeah I am frustrated with them,1
what do you think your dad wants you to be like,1
I can really hear you really love your that don't you,1
so it's this feeling that only a part of you is acceptable and that doesn't leave much room for you to be human does it,1
yeah and if his love for you is based on picture what's the good at that,1
so this is the conflict it's really hard for me because I want to give you an answer and I really wish that I could give you the answer you want I really mean that,1
well I don't mean to be evasive about this but I just I want to know what do you think you should do in this situation,1
and so I catch that the real deep puzzle is you feel this what should I do sometimes it's sad for me to notice how hard you are on yourself about yourself and I really appreciate you sharing this with me well,1
and so the thing that comes to mind is me asking what do you wish I would say to you,1
yeah I really hear that and to me at the same time you don't sound too uncertain,1
yeah judging by the tone your voice it sounds like the thought of doing what your dad wants you to do is more uncomfortable than it is for you to actually tell him how you feel,1
and so you sort of feel this I want my dad to like me for who I am,1
when I think I'm hearing you say is that you'd like to feel accepted for your dad,1
well I feel like this is a really private thing that I couldn't answer for you but I'll definitely try to help you come to your own answer,1
I'm really not sure it's an awfully risky thing to live and you'd be taking a chance with your relationship with him and you'd also be taking a chance with yourself,1
that sounds really upsetting I think what I'm hearing you say is that by controlling food is the only way that you feel it you can make a choice for yourself,1
so you're feeling anxious at the moment and like your only relief is in controlling what you eat,1
so it's quite clear that the problem isn't just with your dad or your relationship with him but it's also at you as well and in this question of how can I accept myself,1
able to come in it's just great you know we haven't seen you in like six months how have you been girl,1
we'll talk about that you know it looks like on here that your ac is down a little bit I think it's down to about ten now yeah so you've really been making some progress tell me about how it's been going ,1
so it sounds like you've really been doing a couple different things that have been working for you it's exercising more which I want to hear about and you've been really looking more at your portion sizes yes you know those measuring pieces we had talked to talk some time about yes and then the third one is Oh taking your insulin at the right times okay I'm really the schedule on where it is yes does that seem to be making you feel better as far as the insulin or what do you noticing ,1
so you've been looking for other alternatives so you still feel like you're doing one but they're doing I'm looking at the carbs a little or seeing where it would be with your sugars ,1
nobody can stop you from having candy completely exactly ,1
so you know how you feel when you get that sugar rush and cry yes that feeling hasn't been something you've enjoyed in the past yeah so you've you've been feeling a little more even keel it sounds like how that's going so talking about the exercise piece you say you've been exercising more what have you been enjoying ,1
oh I know you said you're really looking forward to that,1
you've been able to manage while you're out with your energy level ,1
and that had added something you've had to use or haven't had to use during exercise also know how good deal good so you've been able to kind of go into it with the right sugar level yes so that you haven't bottom doubt ,1
well with all these things that you've been working on so well what what's your main goal right now what's something that you're you know really trying to be focused on for you ,1
so so keep moving in that direction we've got it from a from a  down to a  which is a huge success in the time period that we've been looking at and maybe let's try to move it down even a little further to you know nine to start and move down to an age exactly okay so that's that's that's great so the bigger goal is getting the ac down a little and then these smaller pieces are your what you're doing to make that happen yes so how important is it for you to have an ac let's say eight in the next six months on a scale of one to ten kinda like that pain scale we use where would you put yourself on a scale of one to ten just how important it is ,1
it's an eighth Wow so it's not a two or three it's an eighth,1
but you said it wasn't about your mom it wasn't about dr. Smith but it was about what Elizabeth wanted yes so what would it take to move you just a little bit higher up to a nine as far as importance what would have to happen ,1
we all have a lot of things we're juggling and to be honest I don't think anyone can ever really be a ten in terms of importance because we have all these things that we have to manage and sometimes they're higher up and sometimes they're lower up depending on the day or even the minute so I'm that same kind of scale of  to  where would you put yourself in terms of how confident you are that you can bring down your ac - what did we say at  within the next six months how confident are you that you can make that happen ,1
Wow yeah wow that is awesome so tell me about that ,1
soreally just continuing to do what you're doing you've already shown here in the last few months that you've dropped it substantially and I'm sure you were really excited to get to see that score you know to see what the number was really gonna be ,1
did you have a sense when you came in did you have an idea of what you thought your number might be ,1
so you could feel confident coming in at hey when I see that number I already know the work I've been doing so it darn well better be lower because yes we're not put into this so that makes sense it sounds like for you just continue to do what you're doing continue on with getting onto the basketball team and you know continuing on with those things you're playing out with your with your insulin you haven't been in the hospital now for over  months so I mean that's you know that's a huge progress in success as far as keeping yourself stable and feeling good and enjoying high school yeah so how bout we check back again you know an hour another  days and just kind of see where that the ac is then yeah and kind of go from there and you know if you have any questions or you're not sure about something by all means you can stop and that's what we're here for okay thanks Liz it's great talking to you today it's great down you too you  ,1
hi-oh Vina how are you doing today it's good to see you ,1
just tired yeah you know we did some pre-visit planning with you and your phq- which is a short depression screen was actually positive so we asked the nurse to give you a little longer screening tool which is a phq- and that actually did come up with a score of  which is in the mild depression range so how does that how does that feel ,1
but you knew something was something was wrong ,1
tell me a little bit more about not feeling like yourself ,1
so you sleep a lot but even though you're sleeping you don't wake up rested no not at all doesn't sound like good quality sleep ,1
I can see where that would be bothersome to you what else what else is going on with ,1
that's particularly hard when those anniversaries come around for the passings of our parents that's a that's a very difficult time I ,1
I'm really sorry for your loss and thank you for sharing that with me I know that's I know that's very difficult so it sounds like your sleep has really been affected you're not getting good quality sleep you're really fatigued yeah I'm just kind of going through the motions it sounds like during the day and then how's your appetite been ,1
so you used to be more socially involved than you are now ,1
so if there was something that you could do about this what do you think you might like to do,1
it's kind of the same old routine um I wonder if it would be okay if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression,1
like you would that be alright most of the time we typically think about medication as a as a possible answer so no medication at this point ation ,1
all right then I think as important certainly perhaps more important than medication is counseling and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and getting some feedback on that ,1
something else might be exercised another possibility would be a natural product there are some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate and those that's another thing that we could talk about if you wanted to learn a little bit more about those ,1
okay if it's okay let's go back to talking about the counseling for a minute and then we can hit some of those other things too okay so um is there a counselor that you know or that you have a relationship with this lady that worked with you during your mom's death is she you don't want us out in the community ,1
so it sounds like you're pretty ready to do that could you say on a scale of zero to ten ten being really ready zero being not ready at all how ready would you be to do some counselling ,1
so a six or seven  why a six or seven and not a four or a five ,1
so it sounds like you've got a connection there already that's really good yeah um does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that yeah I can definitely check with her and see if she can see me again okay yeah ,1
well that's okay then it would be all right if we talked a little bit about the exercise I know you said that didn't really sound like an option for you at this time and that's perfectly fine only you can make those decisions Alvina but if it's okay I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain okay exercises is again a number of studies has been shown to be as effective as prescription antidepressants okay I didn't know that yeah it actually raises serotonin have you heard about serotonin yeah I asked kind of the happy hormone yes so um it actually raises serotonin and also something called BDNF which is well it doesn't really matter what it is but it helps actually your your brain actually grow and help repair itself so exercise can help in lots of ways by improving serotonin and decreasing stress certainly and in actually improving the quality of sleep how does that sound at this point ,1
right now we can try that absolutely again those are yours to sit your decisions and I'm I'm here to really support you in those so if those sound like things that you might be willing to do I'm I'm all for it well I'll try then let's go on the medication ,1
so you have some friends that are already involved in an exercise program yeah is that something you talk with them about and that you possibly could get into that group ,1
so it sounds like a wide variety of things that you could do yeah which of those tend to interest you most,1
very good well I think it sounds like this is important for you to to feel better and it sounds like you're really ready to kind of make a plan how do you see this fitting into your life at this point again kind of getting back to the counseling and and the exercise ,1
yeah let's talk a little bit more about that you're say on a scale of if we can do use another one of those scales zero being confident that you could start an exercise program zero being not very confident at all in  being very confident tell me where you are in this exercise thing ,1
sounds like a pretty strong commitment yes I'll try it,1
okay and tell me a little bit more about your plan for exercise at this point,1
I think that's a great decision you have a couple of friends in mind that you could call ,1
tell me about a plan that you would think could perhaps get you going with with the exercise ,1
it would be difficult to do it in the morning you don't see that happening,1
you think it would be easier to do it after work ,1
well good it sounds like we have a plan for the counselor and when you check out today I will put this in your record and that will want to get in touch with the counselor that you work with when your mom was going through okay her passing in the grief situation and then I'll want to depend upon you to call your friends and then get involved in the exercise program ,1
all right and if it's okay I'd like to call you in a week to one see how you're feeling and to the exercise is helping you may really find that after you give the exercise a good trial you may actually look forward to it because my hope is that will actually help you feel better and improve your mood and then I would also like to see you back in two weeks just to check on things now we've talked about exercise apartment we've talked about medication not being on the table at this point but I want you to know you know you can call anytime and I will work to get you in and that might be something that we need to do if our plan is not working okay  ,1
hi Michael it's good to see ya well glad you came in today when I douse up,1
well I appreciate your bringing that up that is does sound frustrating but by coming in it gives us a chance to to sit down and and and talk and see how things are going with the medication which is what I'm most concerned about I know we started at about three months ago or so and I am real interested to hear how you're how you're doing on,1
so kind of has taken the wind out of your sails,1
yeah doesn't sound like it's working well too working too well for you have you tell me about how you're taking the medication have you taking it very regular,1
okay so you've been pretty consistent and taken,1
anything else going on in terms of symptoms no just this overall lack of energy which I know my wife doesn't particularly care for,1
your wife coming a little bit more about how it affects the relationship between the two of you,1
so sexual performance is not as good as it as it might be,1
so does this sound like something that you want to continue or should we talk about possibly other other options for you it sounds like it's kind of affecting your life negatively well,1
yeah so taking care of your blood pressure is is very important to you,1
again it doesn't sound like this particular medicines working out too well for you if it's okay I could talk to you about possibly changing the medication so on the one hand we'd be keeping your blood pressure under control but on the other hand we wouldn't be causing these types of side effects hopefully would that be okay,1
yeah so uh I think probably it sounds to me like probably changing medications at this point as a start we can always add another medication later if that becomes necessary,1
so you'd at least be willing to try a change and and see how that goes,1
if it's okay I can tell you about a group of medications that I I like but if but first if it's okay that they give you a kind of my rationale for using that medication to start with so you know one of the things you'd mentioned to me was some of the financial concerns and the medication that you're on is pretty dirt-cheap and for most people at this dose particularly a low dose because you have mild hypertension most of the time it doesn't have many side effects obviously for you that was different does that make sense,1
yeah so the medication I'm thinking about is something called an ACE inhibitor ACE inhibitors are very very well tolerated and occasionally people will get a dry hacky cough with them but it's fairly rare but there's very low risk of side effects in terms of sexual side effects in particular and most people as a matter of fact it's one of the the drugs that actually helps your heart beat a little bit stronger and better and many people don't have any kind of a decrease in their energy so how does that sound,1
okay so what other things can you tell me about that might affect your blood pressure,1
and if it's okay I'm going to write down some of these things that as we talk through them so what else can affect blood pressure that you know of,1
it can't it can't anything else you can think of,1
well sometimes sometimes weight can be an issue and explain this little tool to you this is for what it's worth called a agenda mapping so it sounds like there's a number of things that you know of and then we can talk about that affect your blood pressure you mentioned stress and an alcohol and we talked about weight certainly you know blood pressure medication can affect you there and I would say another big one might be exercise does all that makes sense,1
so we could we can talk about a lot of these things with which one might you want to talk about and if we need to we can set up for appointment and talk about this more if we run out of time but,1
and tell me about the exercise that you're doing,1
so you carry your bag or do I drag it along on a pull cart,1
it is exercise it is exercise Michael look at your your weight when we came in,1
and you were about 160 or so yeah which is actually according to your BMI body mass index in the in the overweight range how do you feel about that,1
yeah you don't look terribly overweight but according to the the charts there it's in the overweight category so you're actually getting you into the normal category would be about a loss of about 15 to 20 pounds,1
I understand I understand but you know I'm not saying that we need to lose 20 pounds sometimes just a loss of 10 pounds can make a tremendous impact on your on your blood pressure,1
so 10 pounds sounds like something that might be negotiable,1
all right so if you were to want to lose 5 pounds how would you go about it,1
and that would actually kind of take care of two of these things right your weight and your exercise both of those would have a really positive effect I think on your on your blood pressure,1
so we've talked about changing your medication stopping the medication you're on changing you to this ACE inhibitor and then perhaps looking at the weight and going getting back to the gym and starting an exercise program is that about right,1
I I really wonder if you would I think that's an excellent question and if you're motivated to lose that kind of weight I'm with you I can't leave I this good I can lose five pounds well it may it may take more than five pounds to get the desired effect on your blood pressure that's really getting back down into that normal weight range if you will in that one 35 to 40 range probably,1
I don't think I'm ready to go there yet Michael but it sounds to me like you want to get off of your medication,1
well it there it's a blood pressure rate that you are right now blood pressure number that you are right now I probably wouldn't recommend that that that's going to take a plan for us to work out over probably a period of months so that you could one lose a little bit more weight to exercise really regularly we might want to talk about the alcohol um can I ask you how much your you're drinking now our regular basis,1
it is okay I'd like to share with you a little bit of information about alcohol and its effect on blood pressure Merryn research has shown that for men more than two drinks a day and for what more than one drink a day really can significantly impact your blood pressure negatively it raises blood pressure how does that how does that sit with you,1
you'll do two okay and you said that you did two three every day,1
can you think of any ways to maybe cut back on that to where you wouldn't be getting as much alcohol in your system on a regular basis,1
so two a day um keep in mind too there are significant amounts of calories involved and alcohol particularly beer,1
scale of zero to ten zero being not willing at all to do that ten being very willing to do that where do you think you,1
tell me the good things about cutting back on alcohol and maybe switching to light beer talking about the good things,1
on a scale of zero to ten zero being not very important and ten being very important how important is it for you to to get better control of your blood pressure,1
so in terms of making a change what are some of the things that you'd be willing to do in order to make that happen,1
okay so to recap changing your medication you're willing to go to the gym and exercise switch to light beer and keep the beer to a maximum of two a day okay now only you can make that decision Michael I can't do it for you is that somewhere that you're willing to go,1
so one more scale in terms of your readiness to make to do this zero being not ready at all and ten being ready where would you fall on that,1
six and a half and watch six and a happen and not two or three,1
so you're really worried again about the health consequences of not keeping your blood pressure under control,1
so if it's okay I'm going to put this in your record that we talked about well we're certainly going to switch your medication but you're going to be working on losing some weight going back to the gym cutting down on your beer usage and switching to light beer is there anything I missed,1
five pounds that's the number now I'd like to see you back and about let's call it a month let's see back in a month,1
my pounds will be gone and we'll see how things are going and probably talk about this some more and see how successful you've been with this plan and then we'll go from there,1
little bit of information as to why you're here but but maybe you can go ahead and just tell me ,1
Wow okay so she's doing pretty tough stance on it ,1
okay all right so pretty important to you I mean she's taking the stance on it your kids have said similar things and now you're here I mean it's gotten point that you've you agreed to go ahead and go into treatment she's saying not just get treatment she's saying quit I mean Jesus she's being pretty yeah she just wants me to stop pretty out of about it okay so what do you think ,1
what's always you feel you know I mean it's like you know you work you you're responsible you do what you think is expected of you and so it kind of feels a little unfair to you know you're a man you're a head of the household you know you're doing your duty and it feels a little unfair to have people trying to dictate your behavior and telling if you've got to give this up ,1
so all right all right well so I guess that's kind of the that's the dilemma I guess you know on the one hand she's uh she's very out of it she's very concerned and is making her expectation very clear on the other hands you know you're being asked to give up something that you don't particularly want to give up um what do you think what do you think she's what you put why do you think she's so concerned ,1
yeah certainly it's you know people can tell you what they want right you know and but all ultimately it's up to your choice what you're gonna do so you know she she can threaten you and she can she can tell you that you know if you don't do this she can you know she's gonna leave and she can leave you know it sounds like you really don't really don't want that,1
okay so she's concerned about your health and has pointed out that you have a you know your father so he drank and,1
so you're not sure if that we died of heart attack okay you know so you're not sure if that played a role in his heart attack or not I probably did probably crank song but so you're not sure about how well you know he died did it earlier and she points that out as evidence that like you've got media genetic predisposition to having health related problems associated with drinking ,1
okay so it almost seems like evidence to the opposite they told you to quit drinking  years ago and here you are it's still alive then ,1
okay so you feel like you know you beaten the odds so else you can say the live ,1
so it's kind of you know the state you know you have this determination you're the kind of person that you know you you do what you trust your gut and you do what you think you should do and you know you work real really hard and you and you've had a lot of success in your life is right it seems like in your in your job and and and with your family the fact that you're a married man with kids and you know you've raised them up and you know I think there's no denying that you had a lot of success in real life in it and and you know and you know better than anyone how hard you had to work could she be back so ,1
okay all right so she's got all these concerns about it how do you and you mentioned your kids have some concerns - they talk about it I mean what is your sense of and it sounds like so far you feel like well I've beaten the odds and I'm this kind of guy like I'm always a kind of guide it sort of pushes the envelope and you know has proven a lot of people wrong over the years and so you're very skeptical when anyone tells you that drinking is going to kill you like yeah is it it's almost like if somebody tells you that you're gonna say you know you're not gonna believe that I mean you just don't believe that's the truth ,1
okay okay all right so what so what if anything in what they're telling you do you believe it turns out like a possible negative effects that I may have obviously it has not killed you you're standing here right now yeah okay so as it killed you but do you think but have you seen any do you think there's anything to anything any validity to what your wife is saying your kids and the doctors with regards to having a negative effect on your health or otherwise I mean just just very honestly if you sit there and you look back and kind of go well and is there anything that you think that is going on that that it's valid right now,1
no no I mean confidentiality is such that no I want you to know I'd never feel comfortable talking I do not assess us but you know,1
well you know gosh I really appreciate the Jew did you feel comfortable sharing with me to know who those things with me and and I can see that you know this has been very painful and I just I can't commend you enough for being willing to put yourself out there and come in and trust this process it's not easy to do so I really appreciate the fact that you've done that  thank thanks for talking again together I'll be hopping your straight shooter or I really appreciate that,1
it's good to see you up and about how are you feeling after your last little hospitalization ,1
so you're you're still struggling to breathe some ,1
so you're better but not quite where you want to be and ,1
so you usually bounce back pretty quickly but this time is taking longer and that's a that's a real concern to you ,1
so that the oxygen piece is something that scary it almost feels like ear were really really sick when you needed oxygen  C	it does I never picture myself needing a I guess I'm scared of needing an oxygen tank and carrying it around with me and having the tubes in my nose um that I just don't see myself needing that I always think of myself as being healthy ,1
and now it seems like you may have some real or some permanent damage,1
Paige would it be okay if we talked a little bit about your disease process ,1
you know with a flare-up of bronchitis like this you very well may have done some damage to your lungs the good news is as you continue to heal I mean we have a spirometry today which is that breathing test that you did we compared that  about six months ago it is quite a bit worse now a lot of that will get better with time but also a lot of that kind of depends upon whether you continue to smoke or not ,1
well Paige we don't have to talk about anything you don't want to talk about um those are going to be decisions that only you can make I can't make you quit and so that's just going to have to be your decision I I want you to know though that I'm here to support you and even though we've talked about smoking cessation and some things that you could do in the past you've been kind of resistant about that I wonder if having this bout in the hospital has done anything to change your mind,1
so bad experience mm-hmm so if we look down the road maybe five ten years and you decided not to quit smoking what do you think that would look like for you,1
oxygen is a pretty strong motivator for you isn't it yeah well so it sounds like if it sounds to me like if if you didn't quit smoking that you feel like your overall health might really be at risk,1
where does that where does that leave you  C	I need to start considering it more seriously than I have in the past if I want a different outcome if it's,1
okay at this point Paige it's great and but let's talk about it's okay what's something called a decision balance so and involves four things to think about it's almost like writing it on a page but we're going to do it in the air or whatever so what are the good things about smoking that you like if you didn't side to quit what are some of the negatives about smoking if you didn't decide to quit and then if you did quit what would be some of the good things and then what would be some of the negative things if you did quit so tell me if you would what are some of the good things about that you like about smoking if you continue to smoke the way you are ,1
so some of the good things are the taste we regularly with coffee and how it makes you feel and then it sounds like there's a big social component to smoking for you there is tell me about then what would be some of the negatives if you continued to smoke and didn't quit ,1
so some of the negative things would be it's a impact on your health right the the smell clothes and so forth and then there's a lot of kind of social pushback,1
it does sound like he's concerned about you and and concerned about your health and that he loves you ,1
but it's on the other hand it's it's hard to put up with some of that stuff and I think I think it shows a lot of inner strength in you to put up with some of that even though it's kind of a pain ,1
so what would be some of the positives some of the good things about quitting based on what you told me here today,1
so again on one hand there are a lot of good things that you enjoy about smoking and on the other hand there you've given me quite a list of things that if you did quit there would be a lot of ways that your life would be better so where does that leave you now ,1
sounds like you're pretty committed so honest let's talk about a scale then on in terms of being ready to quit zero being not ready at all and ten being like yeah I'm really ready to quit where are you on that do you think ,1
not a pretty picture no no it's not tell me some of the things that you are aware of that can help you in this quest,1
would it be okay if we talked about that for a minute sir this is a fantastic program page they have a lot of information but the great thing is you can actually have your own personal smoking counselor and you can call them or you can leave a message with them to call you but there's a tremendous amount of support there and that's been a very helpful thing and the great thing for me is they will actually call me and give me kind of follow-up information on how you're doing mmm how does that how does it sound ,1
so he's just uh sounds like more support right you wouldn't feel you wouldn't feel alone in this battle right yeah so I heard the nicotine patches and gum and then possibly the Quitline anything else that you've heard about or that you might be interested in there,1
again decisions that only you can make H and but if it's okay I can tell you a little bit about the research about the quit date okay um most of the research shows that if indeed you can kind of look at your calendar and see a time that would be better to quit them than not it's really helpful to have a quit date and to tell as many people as you can about that this is the day I'm quitting again it tends to garner that social support and increases the commitment level how does that sound,1
is there any time that would be better for you to get a quit date than another day ,1
would it be okay if our office called you on that day to just begin to give you a little bit more support let you know that we're with you sure that would begin so let's go back to another one of those scales scale of  to  in terms of your confidence about doing this zero being no confidence  being they have a lot of confidence about my ability to quit where would you be on that scale ,1
well congratulations I think that's probably the biggest health decision that you could possibly make in your life particularly in light of what you've just been through so right I think this is a really good time and I have I applaud your courage doing it takes a lot to to make this decision so good for you ,1
so I will call you and we'll give you some information about the Quitline when you leave you can take care of the patches and and gums instead of over-the-counter and if it's okay let's schedule an appointment and two to three weeks out and get you back and see how things are going  ,1
hi Quinn I'm glad that you came to see me today my name is me and I'll be your nurse what would you like to talk about,1
sounds like you're concerned about eating too many five foods and not exercising enough so which of these two concerns would you like to focus more on today,1
okay well I appreciate you bringing it up it's true many people diabetes find it hard to add exercise to your life especially when their busy schedules it must seem overwhelming to have to fit exercise into your life when you have so many other priorities,1
so tell me what's living with diabetes been like for you,1
you must be so stressful how to make so many changes to your life because of your diabetes adding exercise to your list of things to do isn't making your life any easier you mentioned that you don't like exercising so maybe we can look from your perspective what exactly you think that and the disadvantages of exercise our first of all what exactly don't you like about exercising,1
you struggle with exercising because you're already tired after coming home from work and exercise increases your fatigue,1
so tell me then what are the benefits of exercising to you,1
you understand that exercising here and prove your overall health,1
so as long as you feel fine you don't see the need to exercise,1
what if you felt that your house was getting worse that you're starting to feel the symptoms of your diabetes even though the symptoms of type 2 diabetes develops slowly in the early stages and can go unnoticed for years if blood sugar is left uncontrolled it can lead to many complications would you like me to tell you more about that,1
for example diabetes can lead to health problems like hypertension nerve damage or even kidney disease,1
that's true insulin is a big part of glucose control and it's also great to hear that you're able to maintain a healthy diet despite your busy schedule that's quite an accomplishment exercise can also complement these effects actually exercise can help your bodies up your blood sugar and has been proven to be more effective or even or just as effective as medication,1
so it seems that being healthy is pretty important to you and that having symptoms of diabetes or feeling sick worries you,1
okay let me summarize what we just talked about you're not sure that you want to be here today the only reason you came is because your doctor felt that exercising more would help you manage your diabetes at the same time you haven't been feeling any symptoms of your diabetes so that's why I don't feel the need to exercise but if indicated that you want to prevent feeling sick and you like to be healthy for in order to take care of your children in fact you're ready doing so many things to help look after your health such as taking your insulin regularly eating a healthy diet and not consuming any alcohol did I miss anything,1
I see where you're coming from normally in order to control her blood sugar you have to live a healthy lifestyle you're ready doing a great job doing that by taking your insulin on time eating regular regularly and healthy diet and not consuming any alcohol so the only other thing you can do is exercise but you don't see the need to exercise and you find it hard to fit into your schedule,1
all right if since you wanted to exercise would you mind if we took some time to find out how i feel about exercising,1
on a scale of zero to ten in terms of how important you feel they need to exercise zero being not important and 10 being very important how important do you think exercises to you,1
seems that you think that exercising is pretty important then how come you're at a seven and not a two or three,1
the thought of not being able to take care of your kids scares you you must love them very much,1
now let me ask you how confident you are from the scale of zero to ten where zero is not confident at all and 10 is very confident in order to regularly exercise,1
so you're moderately confident what would help increase your confidence,1
in the past what is help you to continue exercising,1
more support from your husband would help you to continue exercising maybe we can also explore additional options as to how to motivate you to exercise,1
well you mentioned that you think exercising will take away from the time you want to spend with your children would you consider including your children in your exercise routine,1
and you mentioned earlier that you used to run to exercise but running is a very high intensity exercise it would be hard for anybody to run for 30 minutes a day would you what exercises do you think would be easier for you to try,1
would you be willing to consider walking for 15 minutes after dinnertime,1
that's a great start would you like to schedule an appointment next week to discuss more about your fried foods consumptions and other ways we can help you to keep exercising,1
hi Sandra thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes I understand you don't have very much time but I really appreciate you stopping by,1
so I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about but that overall coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter so can you tell me what was it that made it possible for you to even come in what were some of the things you were thinking about,1
so the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking,1
and it sounds like you're smoking setting an example those are some things that that you're also a bit concerned about but as you said earlier not not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately,1
so Sandra what's good about smoking what do you like about it,1
okay so is there anything else that you like about it,1
so let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking the things that you like about it and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out,1
so it sounds like it's a way to relax it's a way to socialize with your friends from work and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke,1
you also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight and concern that if you are we're going to quit smoking what that would do in terms of gaining weight and that smoking after meals is pleasurable that it's something that would be really hard to give up,1
I also heard that it's very much a part of your life it's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a nonsmoker does that capture for you some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking,1
so I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking what about the other side can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things,1
Sandra can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her,1
so this morning that experience it really brought home how she does watch you and she does really look up to you and notice what you do how did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you,1
and again thanks for your honesty in talking about this I appreciate that this is a this is a tough topic this is a hard behavior to think about giving up I guess one thing that one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that you know on the one hand you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter,1
and on the other hand I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief socializing and it's something you can't imagine ever changing how do those two things fit together,1
so why would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important that raised it up in the list of priorities for you,1
so it's it's not so much that you don't want to quit in a way it's almost how could I do it that would work for me,1
okay I appreciate we we probably used up the time that we have I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this is that something that would be helpful,1
not necessarily the most exciting thing for you to do but I appreciate you willing to do that can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week I promise it's not too time-consuming we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change why you would even consider quitting smoking and then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days,1
so thanks for coming in Sandra we'll see you next week,1
can you talk about the transformation that you see in people,1
I mean realistically not everyone is a success story and we see its relapse it's a part of recovery but but for most cases though that difficult cases that do a good job and make that transformation when does that usually occur,1
so they finished the first month of treatment and then it's time to go back to their life because they have to work or they have school or they have kids at home that's what you're talking about that's what's what's difficult or scary for you when they have to leave,1
is there a strategy that you use that that that you have found to be successful in your experience with maybe that the problem cases are the harder cases,1
so I guess the message here is that the transition is really important yes the treatment facility is good you could need to go to the detoxification the group therapy but it's also that transition period in every facility I think has a an intensive outpatient program or a sober living environment or at least the referrals that you can get to that so it doesn't just stop after the 28 days it continues and that's I think what we're saying professionally here well actually leads us to the last our last show we we met with the girl named sunny and we're gonna do a flashback here but sunny was basically offered treatment and she she's knows so much about herself she's very good at saying exactly what she feels and she you could just see there was no hope there she basically said look I've been through these programs I helped run these programs I was a counselor and I was going into the bathroom and I was shooting up in the bathroom and I was going out and no one even knew it for weeks and weeks and weeks and so then at this point she's like well I'll try it but why bother at this point I'd been through it all I know myself and we've all been there where we knew ourselves we knew that nothing was going to stand the way of our using we wanted to stop but our head just check something happened in our brains and something happened with with our lives that all of a sudden we would go back to using again and she knew herself but is it always is anyone a lost cause that's it always worth it,1
there's always another chance no matter how bad it gets is it possible can we talk to your,1
is there a willingness or you are you basically giving up,1
so what I'm asking you at this point will you give it one more shot and are you willing to go to treatment,1
at this point what do we have to lose you know what's scary,1
thank you so much for doing this i know that it hasn't been easy,1
there was one part where we actually asked her it was cut out we said you know do you want to go to treatment she says,1
you know you you were honest about being a manipulator you were honest about the other programs you went to what's it like now for you what was it like what was different about this place,1
the transition that we see just on the outside as well I mean people at home need to see that because when you're working for a facility at one point shooting drugs into your neck and then your back at home wondering how am I everyone do this because every Center that I went to i manipulated it and I ended up pulling one over on them and Here I am again back at home shooting drugs or using suboxone or whatever it is that you were doing I like to just take a few minutes to have your your dad and you have a little boy come up and talk to them just for a fitting,1
hi mr. seed or if my name is Dave it's nice to meet you I'm your pharmacist here today,1
are you picking up for yourself today or for somebody else,1
for you great I see you have a new prescription here so what I'd like to do is take about five minutes just go over some key points about this medication how to take it and answer any questions that you might have so you're feeling comfortable with this medication that's not alright,1
I want you have a seat here sure so to start off I'm just going to verify your information real quick so we said your name's Larry seedorf is your date of birth let's see,1
and it looks like are you still on same address as before,1
pinnacle okay and I have here according your profile that you have a sensitivity of statins which is the type of medications is that correct,1
okay and according to your profile it looks like you're taking likes in Aprill hydrochlorothiazide and simvastatin which is one of those medications,1
not taking any more okay great no problem then what happened when you took the statin,1
okay well hopefully you won't have any issues like that with this one I'll be sure to go over this with you okay,1
so the name of this medication is gem fib Raziel it's the generic for low pay,1
now before I go into more detail about this medication what concerns do you have that you'd like me to address with you here today,1
certainly I understand that and hopefully you won't have the same issues with this one I will talk about that before I get to that though what did your doctor say this medication is used for,1
we see this a lot with lowering cholesterol especially triglycerides which are a type of cholesterol,1
now how did your doctor tell you that you're going to use this medication,1
twice a day so you'll take one tablet which is 600 milligrams and just like it says on here it's actually two tablets so you'll be taking a total of 1200 milligrams and you'll be doing that by mouth twice a day so the best time to take it is about a half hour before breakfast and then again a half hour before dinner if you can remember that,1
okay now one important thing about this medication is this is in addition to diet and exercise so keep doing that healthy diets all that exercise to help lower your cholesterol as well,1
now what side effects did your doctor tell you that this medication made cause,1
hopefully it will now it's still possible it may cause that you are in kind of a high dose most people do fine on it I mean it's a different it works in a different way than the statin so if you experience that just let your doctor know but most people do do fine,1
now other side effects you might experience you might have a little bit of stomach upset if that happens just take it with food and that should help okay,1
as far as storing it keep it in this bottle that'll protect it from light and from moisture keep it at room temperature you know nothing fancy,1
so once you're getting low go ahead give us a call we'll be happy to get you your refill,1
all right great now I've given you a lot of information yeah just to be sure that I've explained everything how are you going to take this medicate take it,1
right you've got it okay good what questions do you have for me about this medication,1
absolutely I understand your frustration try to stick with it you know because it is important we lower your cholesterol but like I said if you start to notice any muscle pain let your doctor know there's other options he may be able to switch you and most people do do just fine on it,1
all right great what other questions do you have for me,1
all right very good so just to kind of summarize make sure that you kind of stick with it if you do start to notice any muscle pain make sure you report that right away,1
take it a half hour before breakfast and again a half hour before dinner if you can but it's important just to remember to take that twice a day,1
of regularly great alright if anything else comes up at all our numbers right here on the bottle give us a call again my name is Dave and I'd be happy to help you any of the other pharmacists would also be willing to help you as well just in case I'm not in so go ahead and give us a call,1
thank you very much I really appreciate your time today,1
what do you feel about the possibility of doing some of that thinking and looking in with another person I hear you clearly saying I don't need you know help I don't need therapy I don't need treatment of any kind but I'm thinking about the exploration area of that and whether or not you have thoughts on how helpful it might be to sit down and be able to sort of chat with somebody about the connection between the alcohol issue and the anger issue and coming back from the war issue and that kind of thing,1
so here feeling kind of two ways but I kind of feel like to get it on my own but on the other hand I would be willing to talk to somebody,1
such as my girlfriend wants me to do and it sounds like there's some reasons that you've got for doing that one of which is a relationship can you think of other reasons that would support the notion of just coming into to chat again and down the road,1
so the one thing that you and your girlfriend Sharon color is that you want change with respect to this anger issue of the,1
yeah gotcha so I wonder if I can move that then to this whole issue of commandment I hear you saying pretty loud and clear I am committed to the relationship I will do what it takes and maybe I would be willing to the level of six to come in and chat with somebody about it down the road would it be help for me to to offer you sort of a smorgasbord or a menu of what we have to offer here and see if any of those view at all,1
well let's talk about then how you ended up cutting yourself,1
so what happened first of all tell me what you did exactly,1
well I mean where'd you cut yourself I know you said you cut yourself with a name as always same as always,1
can you say hey you can oh those look to me like they they did you go does it it doesn't look like you went and got any stitches but that looks to me like you could have used them what do you think,1
okay part of the problem is those look deep in like you're going to have significant force so my suggestion is in the future if you do is that you put some sort of bandaid on it to keep it closed now let's talk about how how this happened list of all tell me you were telling me on that phone that you wanted to die but did you assist a suicide attempt or do things just to cutting your thinking about killing yourself of wanting to kill yourself of wanting to die and again,1
so let's okay so it sounds like me not being a bit with me not being available if you rate related to you cutting yourself,1
I understand you come here today today's antsy because you had a recent arrest,1
how come on marijuana how recently was this do you like about we could uh okay so what's been going on what happens,1
so you feel like you can get out of the rehab are too ,1
alright so with this recent arrest we realize it may be value to stop using the joy don't want to ,1
feel better when you drink you ever socialize at the same time,1
so thought it was what people are doing it so does it sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using not really so what are you losing ,1
alright so you have the use that takes away pain for you ,1
so you can't imagine that so is look at the other side can you imagine having further instance with law enforcement we're charges in the future,1
so you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not a really heavy consequence and you'll be more careful in the future,1
so with that thinking you continue to use as you were that you take out the part that got you in trouble,1
the first you have to get out of trouble this time yep so if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it,1
alright so you know if you had no anxiety no pain you'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends mm-hmm how would they respond if you went out with them,1
so the quitting alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good rap for you know but then you have this this recent situation which is making you second guess some of it ,1
so you could reduce your usage avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety in the name ,1
okay so that strategy might not work that's something you've been tossed around though this ideas isolate a little bit more and drinking a little less seems like all your options here kind of ground yeah that just such as mayor's it seemed that way to you too now that I'm like talking through it,1
oh really oh alright so what store do we know or pick up with what we know you don't want to make a bad impression in this whole court proceeding with the deal I what do you think you could do that would make a bad impression ,1
alright so you want to avoid those behaviors for sure so you know for sure you don't want to do those things would it be acceptable to do this thing's anyone,1
yeah all right so would you appreciate those as goals like avoiding those situations like going the court chug yeah goals that you could get behind home come in ,1
well it's gonna be hard to like not turn that day you're not striking me is overly enthusiastic about this idea this is this is really tough for you if the alcohol in the marijuana that are important to you yeah this hold this so do you I think it's really just encroached on somebody at going on that you enjoyed yeah so is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life event that does that change things ,1
what if as a condition of your treatment the judge says no more drinking in the more marijuana period like it's either that you obey those rules or or jail now so they wouldn't get to that,1
how long have you been used in the alcohol marijuana,1
have ever until now with the DUI have you ever envision stopping know what's your plan like pre do you i will is your plan in all this,1
yeah so without this or something you would have continued using yeah weird years to come,1
you could give a shot you're just not sure you could you could actually do it ,1
yeah so what do you want to go from here you have this to you I I imagine a hearing some time coming up right here to see me what can I do to help you ,1
you want to stop it be easier to actually do it then like a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality ,1
alright so between now I'm going to see again do you have any hearings or anything coming up no they're not for like a few more weeks few more weeks hi so I'll see you again and I have the iop and everything here I'll see you again in a week and let's pick up with that anything changes we're hearing is moved up just slumming now okay thanks Mel B ,1
hi my name is Kaylee I'll be your nurse today I'm just want to tell you that there is confidentiality piece here so everything you say to me is confidential so if there is a chance that you might be harm to yourself or to others or there is a chance of child abuse then I have to let someone else know,1
so why don't we start by you telling me a bit about your day and the struggles you're having to include exercise where that those barriers are coming up and ,1
okay so you're I hear that you're struggling to find time to fit exercise into your schedule and you're starting to feel pretty frustrated and discouraged with the situation ,1
okay well how important is this change to you how much do you want to make this change in your life um let's say from a on the scale from zero to ten with the CEO being not important to me at all attending very important to me,1
okay okay very important and how confident would you say you are about making this change right now ,1
okay so from what I hear you saying you've had some success in the past without cheating behaviors related to your diabetes it's just life is just simply getting really right now so you have been successful in the past and it sounds like incorporating exercise into your schedule is going to be another really difficult change that you're not sure you want to make but is important to you is that correct ,1
I'm glad you didn't come in today it shows that you really care about your health and you want to manage your diabetes better I'm sure it was really difficult to come in today especially since you're not sure you want to make this change ,1
so from what I hear you saying um you're having difficulty fitting exercise into your schedule and you know the importance of exercise for diabetics what would it be beneficial to you if I provide you with a little more information would that be okay ,1
okay well but you exercise can help lower your blood glucose and that's important for diabetics and I can all also help lower your blood pressure regular exercise can also increase your energy improve your sleep strengthen your bones muscles there are a lot of benefits which one of those benefits do you think you would appreciate the most energy I'm really glad to help how can you say that like,1
it sounds like you're getting kind of excited something that connects my life and like it makes sense right so you'd really you'd really benefit from including exercise oh and it sounds like you're really willing to try to change can you think of some ways you might include exercise in your day,1
do you think you'd be able to how often would you be able to walk them to school this week,1
so would you you'd be able to walk them to school every day and maybe keep a track of that you've done it for the day and maybe just check it often that way you know you know you've got your exercise in ,1

ok well mrs. key relapses are normal they're your part of the process the important and is for you to move don't be too hard on yourself just move on ok but so what I'm hearing is that it's very important for you to take your mackerras ,1
ok so unless the same skill and before  to  ok how confident are you to take your medications if you decide to do so p not confident  being confident will out-sing ,1
okay so can you think of anything you can do to help you remember anything at all during the day ,1
yeah that's what that sounds good is it okay if I share some thoughts with you as well ,1
sure so you can actually attach taking your medications to various activities of the day in for instance you can have your own money medications with breakfast after medications with lunch evening medications with dinner okay what do you think ,1
ok ok so I'm going to give you this study sheet I'll seemingly to listen please hang it on your fridge and then there's whenever you take your medications just take it off and then when you are coming back into this comedy so we see the puppies ok that sounds like a visible plan and hanging it on my free to actually reminding good yeah it is the keys are seeing two weeks ,1
"Thanks for comming today. I haven't look in your file, what brings you in today?",1
Is there certain situation where you find more stuff are you saying?,1
T: 	This sort of respect team? So it sounds that you have been dealing with this for a while?,1
T: 	How confident are you that you want to change in a scale of one to ten?,1
T: 	So you are pretty confident about you wanting to change.,1
hi my name is Ashley and I'm with counseling services here at UT um let's start by having you tell me a little bit about yourself and what brings you in to see me today ,1
well I've heard ohio  is a pretty nice place to live and the veterinary program is great here at UT um tell me a little bit more about why your parents think you should come to counseling ,1
wow what a big transition for you to move from Ohio to Tennessee takes a really strong person to be able to do that so I hear that you're kind of lonely hearing to this II and things are really different from back home so you're too been trying to keep yourself busy with school school work and sometimes you get overwhelmed,1
okay I hear what you're saying that your studies are really important to you let's try to focus on why we're here today tell me more about feeling overwhelmed with school ,1
so it sounds like you have a large workload and you already have a lot on your plate and now your parents are nagging you about going to counseling ,1
okay see so you had a lot of commitments in high school you did get stressed out but that was a little different it was a lower level stress compared to how you're feeling now it sounds like you had control over your stress level that time what did you do differently in high school to help you alleviate this stress ,1
okay so it sounds like you felt like you had a lot of people that you could turn to at that time and now you can exactly turn to them like you once did because you decided to go off to different schools ,1
it sounds like it so what do you think it would be like here at UT if you would continue to go to counseling and we're eventually able to feel less overwhelmed than how you feel now about your course load ,1
okay so on one hand you feel like it would be a relief to be less stressed and overwhelmed about your schoolwork and then on the other hand you feel like you just don't have time to go to counseling because you have so much work to do ,1
and um what worries you about the anxiety you've been feeling lately ,1
okay so you're really devoted to your studies and you think that you could be able to get through it but you're hoping to find some new techniques to help you manage your stress while you're here at UT ,1
so it sounds like your parents have been voicing a lot of concern about you lately and they really care about what's going on with you and it makes you feel like you did when you live with them in high school and it's hard because you can't find anybody here that you can fit two ,1
okay so you feel like you don't have a single person here in Knoxville that cares about you ,1
okay um so you do feel like there are a few people here and not spill that are concerned about you um let's do some activities that I like to do with some of my clients um and then we can talk about them I like to call this first activity the confidence ruler okay so go there's just a little scale on there and on a scale from one to ten can you show me how confident you are that you will eventually be able to manage your stress and figure how to manage it better okay I fancy so you pointed to his six um can you tell me a little bit about why you pointed to a six why not a zero ,1
okay I hear you so on one hand you feel confident that you're able to manage this home course load and the stress level and on the other hand you're unsure because you don't have the same social support it's like you did back home ,1
so you're a little out of your comfort running zone so to say you don't feel as comfortable running here as you did back at home with your friends yeah I would say so okay um tell me more about your family rating on that assessment ,1
well that's a pretty tough decision and um well I really think that you have the personal capabilities to come to that decision on your own I can tell from talking to you that you're a point in your life where you can make big decisions like that on your own ,1
yeah so it seems like we've uncovered a lot of ground today I feel like I have a better sense of who you are where you come from and how do you feel about coming back to talk to me well I still really like that my parents are making me do this but I guess it would keep them off my back for a while and who knows maybe it'll help I feel like you'll be able to find your fit here at UT I really do and I look forward to our next session  ,1
were hoping to discuss today the pain in my ribs is still too much for me every time every time I take a deep breath or even just bend down to know feed my dog or something it's miserable,1
sounds like you've been in a lot of pain and it's made it pretty difficult to do some of the things you normally do so tell me a little bit about your routine and and what your pain is like ,1
sounds like you're really acted before and this pain is really causing a lot of problems for you if you would rate your pain on a scale of  to  where would you say your level is,1
what kinds of things have you been doing to manage your pain ,1
okay so you you're taking the oxy you're smoking some weed can you tell me a little bit how you been taking your medications and how often you're smoking ,1
ok so the hot and cold didn't seem to work the topical cream didn't seem to work and it sounds like you've been taking the axion smoking some weed and that's been a little bit helpful tell me what else you've tried for your pain nothing else besides that really like ,1
now i'm curious if you had a magic wand and you were able to wake up tomorrow and your life was different what would it look like ,1
Steven I think those are really great goals and I think those are things we need to be working towards and as your doctor I also need to share with you that I'm concerned that you're still on the oxycodone six months out from your injury six months really isn't that long,1
well I'm not trying to push you but I do think it's important for us to think about pain management that is not going to cause you more problems and it's going to allow you to get back to the lifestyle that you really want to be living what kinds of things do you think would be helpful ,1
Stephen I don't mean to be pushing you but I do want to talk about maybe what the the next steps would be to be helpful for you ,1
i think it's really important that we choose a plan that you feel like you're able to do that works with you and you feel capable of following through with now thinking about what you've done already what do you feel like would be helpful at this point,1
great i do i'd actually love to share some information with you from the Center for Disease Control they have some guidelines about how we approach pain management in situations like this would it be okay if I talk with you about that ,1
so what the the guidelines do say is that for people who have had injuries like yours but we want to be using prescription pain medications in a certain period of time where it's effective and that tends to be six weeks so we're beyond that at this point now from that point what we like to do is transition you to over-the-counter medication so taper off the oxy and go to things like tylenol a leave and motrin and do that in combination with some holistic therapies like we've talked about before you know when people are on the oxy for longer than six months we put you at risk for some opiate dependence and some other health concerns,1
at this point is to think about transitioning you off of the oxy onto one of these over-the-counter medications and using some of these other techniques to help you manage the pain what do you think about those guidelines and maybe that plan,1
yeah i hear that it's scary to to maybe do anything that might increase your pain that makes a lot of sense and i'm not opposed to prescribing you some some other medications for pain but as your medical provider i also have to say that I don't think smoking marijuana is the best means to manage your pain right now and I'm wondering what you think about making some of these changes ,1
i do and i think we need to think about what you're willing to do what you're able to do and what you feel like you can do most consistently so it sounds like at this point we're thinking about tapering off the oxy getting you on to something like tylenol and doing some exercise that you feel like you can do how do you feel about this plan ,1
and I want you to call me and I think it actually makes sense for us to set a time within the next week for us to talk maybe do a phone check in and see how you're doing and even if you're not doing any better and then we can take it from there and see what changes we need to make to the plan,1
well I have to say I'm really glad that you came in and I think it's very courageous to take the step and facing some of this pain as well to get you back to the life that you really want to be living right now so I thank you for coming in and I'll see you I'll  ,1
Morning stops For morning money so still a game with the psychiatrist working in the drug alcohol service ,1
I understand that he wants to talk but some of the difficulties that you've been experiencing lately.  ,1
 I appreciate you taking a big step and coming here to see me today I'm sure your relationship means a lot to you and you definitely want to sort things out with your partner I do you know can you can you tell me a bit more about what Brenda's concerned and how you see the situation ,1
OK and how long have you been.  Employed as a builder full.  ,1
OK but you self-employed or you might in other cases you're in your business How's that going ,1
So just a focusing and you know when you're drinking is it alright if I call you by your first name Greg that's for you ,1
"So Greg, just focus on your drinking, can you tell me a bit about when you first started drinking when ",1
and what would you start thinking of doing.  And how's how's that progress to over time dark,1
OK so if we focused over the last month What's your what would be your average intake over the over weeks ,1
OK So about five Do you drink in a regular basis every day year after year without ever be a little bit more saying seven eight nine ten.  ,1
OK what would be the maximum you could you would drink in a day.  ,1
 you did mention that when you were sixteen you started drinking and over the years I mean you've moved from being two to whiskey now but have you found that over the years your alcohol intake has increased.  ,1
and do you feel in the same orderings to get the same effect as you used in the past same buzz.  ,1
when was your last period of abstinence when you do not drink it all.  ,1
OK So you've been a fairly regular drinker over the last.  Several years here OK.  Have you ever experienced withdrawals when you've stopped drinking we experienced severe shakes use weightier trembling hearts beating really fast.  ,1
Brant is obviously concerned about you drinking has a drinking ever got mean gotten into trouble with with the police ,1
what about serious head injury where you lost consciousness and then.   ,1
OK Do you have you ever had blackouts we don't remember we don't the previous day ,1
so you didn't talk but you did mention the drink driving trouble with the police because of that and you were at home the relationship with brained How's that been affected as ,1
OK All right so just summarising you if you started drinking when you were sixteen you move from beer to whiskey now and now he drinking and in a fairly regular basis you do crave for it after after work.  And you sort of require a bit more to get the same buzz as well.  Yeah yeah have you ever tried stopping yourself in the past.  ,1
 Over the last say month or so how would you describe the mood mood for Young.  And the felt unusually low depressed in yourself you know are you able to enjoy time with your friends and work yeah yeah yeah OK your energy levels keeping up with work on your sleep What's that been like.  ,1
have you ever had any strange experiences at all.  Like hearing voices when you're in the wrong.  Doing paranoid know people trying to harm you conspire against you in any way you know what about anxiety feelings of nervousness.  Worrying about simple things that you shouldn't be worrying about ,1
OK we've talked about the alcohol do you use any other drugs besides our whole you know like cannabis cocaine and veterinarians in.  Have you ever used them in the past.  ,1
OK Have you ever had it on a regular basis not at all no OK almost.  Just moving on from there  You said that you have your own business and you work as a builder is that correct Have you ever been to work under the influence of alcohol no no I'm not about that OK Do you.  Drink Fest in the morning no different than any financial difficulties that you're experiencing because of the all knowing.  ,1
How do you see your of your alcohol use of this point in time.  ,1
Tell me tell me what you think of the other good things about drinking what does drinking do for you ,1
C:	helps me relax after work.  Hanging out of the boys.  Yeah I have a voice being pretty shy I as a person is a troll.  So I do need you know that confidence  OK So correct me if I'm wrong it gives you confidence because you generally are a shy person it helps you relax after work yes but we've spoken about the good things if I have to ask you  what is the less good things about drinking what would that be.  ,1
You mentioned that parents of.  The talked about you looking at a little bit less healthy.  Do you have any medical problems at all or diabetes high blood pressure.  And can.  That ever have faints or seizures as a result of not having or call having alcohol.  ,1
T:L	so just to summarize the less good things that you mentioned you talked about your relationship your family's really really concerned.  The drinking driving charge as the five as yet where you ended up hurting yourself quite seriously.  And then the other there's good things you can think of,1
 We've looked at the positives the drinking the negatives the drinking What foods do you have now.  More.  ,1
What what do you think.  Of the advantages of you actually stopping or cutting down the drinking buddy thing might be the advantages.  ,1
 I mean all those things that encourage you to make a change or yeah there would be made.  Do you feel that I mean what other any other things that would encourage you to actually make that change.  I don't think I'm getting around well the fact that you're here in the case that it is a part of you sort of wants to wants to maybe make a change or look at it seriously and would I be right in saying oh.  Yeah yeah OK.  Well what do you think might be the practical things that would help you make that change if you did decide to make that.  I'm not sure I'm over well that's something we can definitely talk about further you know we can always come up if you do decide to cut down drinking and look at it seriously then can talk about different strategies to do that.  Do you do you have any fears about making that change you know stopping drinking because I understand it is a big part of your life do you have any fears about stopping it.  ,1
I think there are a number of things that we need to consider Firstly the the amount you drinking which is approximately as you said you know looking at five drinks an average per day is definitely above the recommended guidelines for safe drinking.  In definitely no strain and also in the United Kingdom soup the normal recommended guidelines would be about two stand drinks per day so obviously as you're exceeding it it's definitely above the safe limits of drinking but in addition you've also got certain characteristics that fulfill a quite serious for what we would call alcohol dependence OK Now what that means is your alcohol use a sort of.  Escalated to a level where you where your body's gotten very very used to it so you're craving for a drink you find difficult stopping in one your bodies requiring more alcohol to get the same effect OK at the same time it's affecting several aspects of your life it's affecting your relationship.  You know social life in the sense that you know you've gotten into trouble with the police you've gotten into fights you know sometimes things can have disastrous consequences with the fight except for your family members a big concern and the concern that this is If things progress you know the amount that you will need will recall will because of the tolerance that alcohol can induce in the body because the body gets used to the amount of drinking that one more and more over time to get the same effect as a result of that it can have both psychological and physical consequences on the physical consequences can be it can affect your liver to a great extent it can affect your brain again just in if in the extent and also of course psychological consequences can cause depression anxiety so there are several things that we need to look at and that this level of drinking it definitely I would consider it problematic so it's something that we can look out.  And and talk about further.  OK but I appreciate that again I say that you've taken and it's a very very big step that you've taken to come in here in and talk to me to there.  And you do seem like you you want to make.  A difference to your relationship.  What I like to do is to give you some information to take on ,1
 about alcohol in the harmful effects of alcohol and one's life one's health because it tends to affect several domains of one's life you know financial social occupational health of the psychological and physical health other family members.  Is all those to the several things that Uncle can affect the like you have a read of it and what we can do is we can have a meeting with yourself and Brenda next time and we can look at it for them does that seem reasonable a sense of oh well thanks for coming in today I'll give you some information take a little catch up in two weeks thank you. ,1
I'll take this thank you talking I want to thank you for filling you know how did you find the actual checkup itself,1
was X go over together sure what asked for this checkup it looks like you scored a thirteen okay which is about a medium so friend dividuals that score  but this is indicating is that year at least at risk for developing some alcohol-related problems and that you may start to experience some difficulties as as it's related to that what do you think,1
yeah it was definitely kidding you're at risk for developing some popular related issues and now okay and it sounds to me from reading this should I say it looks like we might be able to do some things that occurred that listen to some of these examples ,1
and I see here that for the third question it says how often do you have four more drinks on one occasion you put monthly could you tell me about this for more drinks on one occasion well you know occasionally you know I usually have a couple glasses of wine with dinner and occasionally I'll just you know then have a couple margaritas after that so I would say that happens about once a month maybe your holidays  ,1
so more towards holidays you're more likely that for money for drink some more yeah and what have you ever thought of that to be I have something that's unusual or is it something tradition you always had ,1
 okay I see here also that question was how often during the last year have you had feelings of guilt or remorse Tony drinking you put less than a month left about that ,1
what I'm hearing is it sounds like you might feel like maybe who's managing money to a degree the last yeah any other feelings of guilt or remorse surrounding it aside from the financial aspect ,1
I think you have a close relation are you in contact with him often ,1
okay I also like to look at number eight and the question was how often during the last year have you been able to remember what happened the night before because you have interacted here you felt less than a month so about it doesn't seem that it's that it's that frequent but there have been times we haven't remember what's happening that there's anything ,1
okay had there been are there other instances in which maybe you couldn't remember certain facts about the day that you contributed  to drinking ,1
that makes sense I may be too also number  Alaska let's review it says has a relative or friend or a doctor or other health care worker and concerned about your drinking or suggested you clip down and you put yester in the last year ,1
how far is the district from where you live to where his colleges about two hours about two hours so you guys get together spend some quality time and then towards the ending of your state you'll have a drink or a fixture margarita and then you'll get on the road yeah and um that sounds like the scenario they probably have lets you being pulled over ,1
yeah I'm wondering if if in lieu of what's happening in kind of in lieu of what this assessment has highlighted what do you think about the connection this window with that particular activity and the drug in home ,1
we do have some services you can't stand up before and what I'm hearing is something maybe open to something like that sure which I think it is really important for our success together ,1
you know these things happen and I think it's very important that you're here and that you're speaking to me about this particular issue and I think it's even more important that you're going to do something about it and I think she got to text me success okay wonderful it's great to hear that thanks thanks so much to doing this was absolutely like you understood that explain this I'm totally open because this has never happened  ,1
Hello Lean my name is Karen and your sis this afternoon nice to meet you nice to meet you so how are you feeling okay,1
burns a little bit but I'm just waiting for the doctor to check my stitches then I'm going home,1
well it's great that's a good thing that you're going home soon um I have ten minutes that I can maybe sit down and talk with you if you have answers or questions for me is there anything that you'd like to talk to me about ,1
yeah yeah and it's just is really upsetting you because you don't think that you need ,1
you don't believe that you're an alcoholic oh I mean I could understand how upset you can be people think that you're something that you're not great um would you like us to explore a bit more about you know why is what do you think that the priest gave you this did you have any ideas why you would hand you such like a brochure like this,1
okay so would you like to tell me a bit more butch his bar fight that you like,1
right and and you you would jump Harry oh yeah and you didn't know what was really going on but you know you just think that maybe this girl was not saying something good to you and then you get into this fight ,1
okay um would you let would you allow me to explore a little bit more about the drinking and alcohol,1
so how does alcohol affect you like what what does he do for you is doing it like ,1
yeah I understand so you you like having fun your friends drinking is a normal thing for you guys to do and you don't see a problem with what you're doing with your friends like you're just drinking one ,1
so it seems to me that drinking is not really a problem that you in your life right now um but would you say though that there are some negative effects that that alcohol is doing in your life right now it would you like to tell me if it's affecting you in that way?,1
so I like it he said your friends drink you drinking is fun something fun but on the flip side and the bad side it's affecting your relationship with your boyfriend he does not like it the way you act are you drinking so it is affecting the relationship negative rate okay um so back in the Alcoholics Anonymous if you of mine I'm so we what do you know about a it's a meeting for people who drink ,1
talk about it okay so you know under your the right track about you know people meeting it's a group of people um that talk about alcohol okay so with your boyfriend it sounds to me that is what you say is how Koren is he in your life marry that guy he's important we're gonna be like together okay so that's great you know at least you're thinking about a feature with Joe and you think that he's really important in your life right now um and then you also said that he does not agree with the drinking I would like to ask you this question now would you be willing to take it a step further and maybe check that ,1
for the sake of your relationship is that something that you're willing to look at willing to in the future,1
um so okay I would like to give you a scale of  to  in a scale one to  how likely would you go and check out one of these programs is ,1
so you would say to safe that's very surprising because it's not a one like it's very good why would you say it's not a one and it's a six that you're likely to go ,1
so I mean those are the things that's really I recommend it for that you're thinking about a future Joey you're thinking that maybe you'll have children with him someday and if you do try you think that it will make your relationship better which one factor should be a good way how well he said it's a six right so what do you think would happen would need to happen to make it a nine for you that you really like most likely to just go in and try one of these programs ,1
okay that sounds good and it sounds reasonable that if it's closer to you it's easier for you to stop by ,1
um if you'd like if you're interested I would be able to help you find a place a closer area where the program is hell it's easier for you to to get there it's closer to your house would you be willing to find out a bit more about that ,1
okay so thank you for talking to me about this whatever village for Joey and how alcohol is maybe affecting your relationship and you know and your may be willing to go and try one of these programs would you like to meet up with me in the next two weeks and see how how this program is to you like if you've tried it if you have any more questions or concerns for me look at where you are at in this situation is that something to do it ,1
okay so Thank You Leanne um this is a big stuff for you I know I'm it's hard to make a step like this but I'm thankful that we have this stuff today and I hope to see you again soon you're too weak ,1
oh it's so good have any way so you know hi study  weeks what do you want is the end it's a really big baby this big you're looking so good from your desire it's wonderful ,1
yeah I know you mentioned last time about the drinking of the alcohol and certain things about that we did cover certain things that can happen when you're drinking now can I ask you a very broad or open-ended question apart from alcohol fetal alcohol syndrome what are some of the other things that you that might happen to you or your baby if we keep drinking during pregnancy ,1
I would like you to go with that with me again if it's possible ,1
it's good to we just keep reiterating on what's important well apart from fetal alcohol syndrome there are some pretty serious conditions that can also come in because if you're still drinking for a start you can get malnutrition it can interrupt your whole metabolism you actually lose your appetite a bit and some of those really important minerals and vitamins that should grab the bag of you and your baby you're going to miss out on so that's going to be one of your big problems and it can also upset your fertility for next time around and not many people realize that so your whole cycle can be pulled out and you might try have trouble falling pregnant again so there's some pretty serious side effects apart from the fetal alcohol syndrome that you might find affect you in your baby also too they found in some recent studies that the baby can be bored very restless and unsettled so even if it doesn't get fetal alcohol syndrome a lot of clinicians say they can see a baby that's been born to a mother who has been drinking during pregnancy there they actually unsettled hard hard to rest though they that they don't follow the normal patent of a newborn ,1
so we really need to work on some strategies down that way so and then probably my next target with you is to talk about how brave you are an affirmation of how brave you are to come in and tell us all about just how this drinking is affecting you and the fact that you want to stop yeah thank you,1
it's so proud of you two coming because a lot of people won't even admit to it let alone come until the Midwife what they're doing when they go home so it's just so very brave of you to come in and tell us all about hey drinking and what we can do together to try and help you stop that ,1
yeah absolutely if you don't have that first if you can stop yourself having that first drink you're more inclined not to keep drinking of course,1
it's wonderful you can't have the strategies you so far,1
that just many want wanting to quit smoking you don't just remind yourself all the time and don't have the first don't have the first and don't start don't start ,1
I said if it sounds wonderful it's really important to that I reflect on your feelings that's all all part of this and from what you're telling me there's a great sense of guilt and frustration with what you're doing is through its draw ,1
oh yeah but you're coming up with these wonderful concrete and practical strategies on how you can attack it ,1
I just want to summarize now because it's so important because this is such a profound topic for you to talk about and it's really important that I've taken on board everything you've said now we've been through I know we've been through apart from alcohol the syndrome that we've talked about in depth we've talked about other things that can happen with you in your baby if you continue drinking we went through all of them one by one and you seem to get a good handle on on those things because you're able to repeat them all to me you told me that you felt this great sense of guilt and shame about the whole thing about drinking but you have no problem talking to me about it which is wonderful and then you came up with these wonderful strategies that you can up with yourself how to remind yourself that it's bad fit with the signs not if you don't have the first drink your lesson plan to have the third of the fourth so how to stop yourself having that first drink you think is how you get these changes so so that's wonderful so I've understood where you're coming from do you think by summarizing little ,1
oh you don't yeah it's totally absolutely dead fantastic I just want us to elicit now some change talk and he did talk about those strategies that you were going to do yourself which is exactly what we want we want them to come from you because they're going to work for you is there anything else that you can draw on to make those things happen to stop your drinking no not at the moment not that I can think of but I'll certainly be more aware keep their end up in my mind so if any other strategies that I can come up with i'm going to write it down and bring it to you when we can have a gentle dead ,1
this week it's really good to see you again how you feeling about where we talked about last week developed or maybe because some changes not do you or I kind of waking up p or need to change inside of you how's it going?,1
so you're realizing all these things that are ramifications of the DUI are really positive stress wants or trigger you to drink but at the same time you really realize this is something you probably shouldn't do and that's ultimately important to you,1
mm-hmm that's so good good insight and it sounds like you're still kind of on the fence um we do permission I'd like to ask if I could possibly use a tool that's worked pretty well for some other books it's called a decisional balance scale and it sort of helps you weigh out both sides of the issue so eun hye fellow a more comfortable and privacy explore reasons to change and what would happen if you didn't if you did change and then also reasons for not changing what what happened if you get that is that something with you willing to do today,1
okay are you comfortable writing or would you prefer me to ,1
ok so let's start what about reasons to change what's going on ,1
good so to open up your social atmosphere baby ,1
that's more of a positive influence and something that's sort of you know makes you fit in but doesn't necessarily make you feel good about yourself ,1
so that would be a positive okay you like to give back some of this experience ,1
so maybe breaking the cycle of what's happened to you for ,1
that would be a positive spoons of a very good husband and some reason it would be really truly meaningful to that spiritual side you mentioned before ,1
okay um anything else before we want to kind of what can happen if you do change know that that's a good that's a good cap solution okay so if you do these things what do you think is going to kind of an outcome just to kind of sum up we have said ,1
okay your family members maybe people in a you really want to be anything ,1
so your associate for fulfillment throughout this process ,1
okay very good things anything else that you feel like maybe these things you'll do you mention kind of some legal stuff over here is there anything that you want to add about that here or is that not important ,1
okay just being able to get back to your life of things that you know ,1
okay so you want to get a learning experience out of it yes all right anything else you want to add this box or should we can review what you wrote ,1
so just to kind of sum up you talk first about reasons not to change is that's kind of where your abs and then we also talked about reasons to change in this kind of writing won't go that was like so you mentioned that you the reasons you might not want changes it doesn't make you feel better when you're stressed out to drink it relaxes you it makes me feel like you can handle things yes um they're also keeps your same social Farrah social sphere of people that you trust and that you enjoyed spending time with and it gives you a way to fit in with those people ,1
okay um the results of not changing your brought out for that if things were to keep going the same way they are that you might get in more legal trouble especially after you have more serious but on the flip side you'd also keep the fence and filling them up don't worry about trying to be that change in the waters ,1
and you mentioned that if you did change that you would feel like you're more spiritually and physically healthier which meant having a more open social clear positive people to you ,1
and then you would be a better inspiration to others and that you might break the cycles in the family issues the patent paths that you've sort of perpetuating right now yeah underneath you feel a little uncertain about your going forward and and then if you did those things that you would feel you more a leader and inspiration to people around you and not really meant to you've been example to others in searching with them fulfillment in this process here you'd also mention that you would get a legal system you know you would have fines be done with all that stuff and not have any of the added pressures that being in the legal system puts on you yes and then you really get a learning experience out of the situation you can really apply for other things in your life ,1
okay David so why don't you take a rinse and how are you feeling ,1
would you like to drag this out what do you think all that was fixed,1
yeah you got rid of that bed yes coloration it was there ya know like that it went well good excellent I did notice quite a lot of staining actually I'm wondering what are your thoughts about what might be related to that,1
yeah all of the above any thoughts on considering quitting smoking at this time ,1
David mm-hmm and I'm sorry that's not how I mean to come across it ,1
yeah and what's been your past experience with smoking tell me can you tell me a little bit about kind of how the role it plays in your life how long you've smoked ,1
yeah and it really is your choice you're absolutely right that nobody has the right to tell you what to do can I ask if you were to if there was to be a situation where you decided I must quit what what would that situation be ,1
mm-hmm so this is something that you you have to pretty much see yourself doing for,1
yeah okay well I really appreciate you being willing to even talk about it and I get that right now this is not something that you want to pursue would it be okay if I brought it up in our next visit because I I know that you've said you don't want to lecture but on the other hand I am I am concerned ,1
yeah yeah well and David honestly wherever you're at will work with it um and so thanks for thanks for taking a couple minutes and talking about smoking ,1
T: so let me tell you what I normally do in this this interview and we will talk for up to it maybe 20 minutes or so normally what I do is just give some feedback from all of those questionnaires that you answered last week and then we just talk together about that so but I always like to just start with wherever you would like to start ,1
T: you were pretty shocked at what you learned about your patterns,1
yeah yep yeah this information has opened your eyes in some ways and as you talked to your roommate about it she was even shocked to know that you were drinking as much as you as you realized when you did the questionnaire ,1
yeah the fact that you're drinking stands out from others is clearly not something you had ever really taken into consideration before thus far I am very,1
good so how is it they going since our last appointment?,1
congratulations on all back to school that's huge ,1
welcome so recent I want to get together to kind of touch base and see how things have been going since your last appointment I know at that time we talked about flossing and there was some inflammation your guns and you're going to incorporate flossing in your daily routine and so I'm just seeing how that's been for you,1
that's common it's a very hectic time frame so so what do you what is your routine like in the evening?,1
okay well how do you feel about flossing after the kids have gone to bed or after dinner before it gets real hectic when you start but not goes to bed?,1
since you since you're so busy and it's very hectic in the evening and it might be beneficial to change the routine to wear when you have a down moment incorporate the flossing at that time okay how you feel well that you think that would work for you?,1
okay people how do you feel about frosting while you're watching TV?,1
no a lot of people are no thing that they have to be in the bathroom or have to do it right before they go to bed but be honest as long as you're removing the plaque and debris from your teeth before you go to bed it doesn't matter if you do it right after dinner or if you do it you know before you go to bed as long as it's being done and we totally ,1
so yeah I think that might have you feel comfortable about incorporating in your routine ,1
well great great okay well what we'll do is today we'll go back and we'll take some measurements of the pocket depths and cannot do and see where your gums are today and then when you come back in three months we'll check again and I think you'll see a huge difference and you'll see the benefit of glossy and you know what the benefit is for your again ,1
yes and have you been lately I haven't seen you in a while yeah I mean I've been ,1
what do you mean when you say you want me to drink like you just let you drag often or it can I ask you about this sir ,1
so it sounds like you're saying that um you drink too kind of forget about school and like forget about you know school ending and moving home get some food or summer and everything like that ,1
hmm um do you do you see like a problem with three king or do you do you think that like do you like does it make you feeling good or bad or like what kind of like effects does it get do to you?,1
well well you said earlier that um you know your grades weren't where you want them when you're gonna go stressed out about it um do you think that like alcohol is kind of having a negative effect on that?,1
you're saying um you also mentioned that you know you go to the bar with your boyfriend a lot do you think that there's any alternative things you guys can do together like possibly like go to the library and son together or you know just kind of have like i annoy you to stay in on the weekends instead of going out ,1
um do you think that there's any changes you would want to make with your drinking or you content with like just drinking you know four days a week every weekend?,1
um how does drinking affect your morals like you like is this I mean if can I ask you like does this run your family or is it something you know that your parents like do and you think is okay or like how does that work ,1
um you said that you know you weren't raised like that you're do parents do you think your parents would like if they knew you drank this much?,1
um do you think you've used to lived at home when your parents thinking about this like it's something with their degree precautions like you'd be kicked out or baby Madi you?,1
um so on a scale of one to ten how likely do you think you could like make this change if you're willing to?,1
it sounds like you're definitely some what motivated to you know getting to getting to you know improve drinking have you ever considered possibly drinking me they like once on the weekend instead of like four times or maybe even limiting to like two or three let me just something like that four times a week ?,1
so it sounds like you're saying that alcohol brings pot of both positive and negative aspects to your life um what do you think that there's more of more positive or negative ,1
um have ou think about the counseling center here in the university?,1
or if you're talking like an advisor about like your grades and they've ever like and you said you lost your scholarships?,1
you could like talk to them about like other stuff like you could talk to them about alcohol um I mean I'm sure that if you had I'm like that like and if they couldn't answer your question necessarily probably would direct you to someone who like could like maybe like a psychologist or someone on campus like a counselor like I said before effort has a Counseling Center where you know you can just go in and talk to someone who you know it was more about like alcohol like people that drink and stuff like that and like how to handle your problems if you're interested I I do have a number but it up to you know ,1
um what you said so you said that you're like a  what do you think it would take for you to get on like a nine or  look what do you think would really change your views on this ,1
um have you ever thought that maybe next year my brother does come that a friend that you know the things you do is like it will reflect back on Hamlin kilowatt to start maybe thinking about drinking and you know kind of like following your footsteps if he sees you out at the bars,1
so that sounds like you're saying that you can't really think if you're like talking about all this you kind of feel like alcohols brought you to more of a negative aspect of your life now that you're considering like your brother and stuff like you putting aside you know the bars and how you feel and your boyfriend ,1
I mean the Counseling Center does offer people it's I mean just it's kind of like what you make of it like if you're willing to kind of go in there and hear what they have to say then a minute there's maybe more advice and probably like statistics that I obviously can't provide um but yeah so if you're will I knew that phone number um but is do Casey yourself improving like do you do you like can you give me an answer as to like how you can improve like do you think you could go down only three days a week at or two or you good for daddy at four?,1
well that's great that you say that you can cut back to three because honestly on you know little by little like improvements occur like you know you if you say you can do three now who knows in a couple months maybe come back to two or even one or I mean even if you have to stay at three for a while that's fine too ,1
well I'm really good you came here to talk about your your situation with the alcohol and stuff but I hope that this helped you ,1
okay thank you thank you for that and first of all welcome to the Hope Center it kind of sounds like looking at your file that this isn't going to be a place where you can get the help that you need should you choose to come weekly so I understand getting your car impounded is a difficult situation thank you for letting me know that and would you like to tell me a little bit about how that occurred in fact why you're here ,1
it's very difficult i'm sure for you be here first of all and second of all it sounds like a la has occurred so you were arrested after being stopped that can be difficult as well having a dog search your car that's very tough to deal with so we arrested you went to court it does sound like though the judge was kind of lenient that works out for you in fact i'm assuming that if you complete treatment that won't go on your criminal record so that's probably good at it also sounds like you're a little concerned about them now your husband might feel about this situation ,1
I totally understand that and it sounds like now your husband just is watching you you have a judge watching you and you're on probation but it also sounds like you care about your family and sounds like in your mind and perhaps your vestments you're a great mother you provide for your children they're well fed their well cared for and this is the only probably been it before so I can see where you might not think that this is this is a problem for you,1
well let me ask you this would you mind telling me about maybe how much you smoke every day and what typical day with or without pot just left for you ,1
so it sounds like wait is this in fact quite a large part of your life your social circles those folks that you hang out with they do that as well as part of your daily routine but it also sounds like you're responsible in that you have a very good job but it's also stressful it is normal for people to look for ways to destress when we come home every day and also to take the edge off as you said morning but it also sounds like you're still making sure you're taking care of your kids that they're fed before they go off to school sounds like there's a lot going on with weed and in your life let me ask you this do you remember a time when you before you were  or time as an adult even that you didn't smoke weed and what life was like for you then,1
so it sounds like you're able to communicate with your husband about your your drug use and nice either understood that or not you decided as a couple that you would stop and and then you started back again so do you see now that may be there there might be an issue with with smoking ,1
right if I can ask you or just let you know and I'm sure you know now there are certain risks when you when you use drugs see you might get caught and you mentioned it earlier that you don't drink and drive but do you see that do you see difference between being high and driving maybe on your way to work in the morning if you smoked a bowl and then perhaps having a couple drinks and drive it to work ,1
okay right so what I've heard it before and what I'm hearing from renounced your where there is a risk and it's kind of impaired you driving at one point at the same time you probably enjoy smoking it allows you to take the edge off in distress and I understand that let me ask you this if you don't mind would you picture your husband here in the room with us and maybe tell me a little bit about what he would say about your smoking ,1
right sounds like a difficult decision and one that perhaps you've made in the past with your husband is a couple because you probably chose that i'm guessing to make sure that you take care of your children it sounds like you're both very loving and responsible parents but there's this one small issue that perhaps as a recurring theme in your life and you enjoy it yet at the same time a thinker sounds like you're aware of the risks that are associated with that though,1
right again it sounds like you're responsible and adolescence is a difficult time and if your children are coming toward that age if they were to see you smoking they could adopt that behavior as well but let me ask you what motivated you to make that change in the past when you and your husband discussed stopping smoking and tell me what that was like just to stop that have you might have done it ,1
right that sounds like that you're you remember the time when you just stopped and what i heard is that you said you have you found ways to destress with it without the use of marijuana so it sounds like maybe you come you might be willing to make a change again at this point in your life ,1
what kind of start like this to be there anymore ,1
so good it sounds like again what I'm hearing is that you are motivated by your children and by the situation perhaps you would like things to be a little smoother between yourself and your husband so think maybe fake down the road let me ask you this where where do you see yourself in a couple of years ,1
sounds like you have some Union husband both have goals for growing your family and tell me tell me what life would love be like as you picture it with two children and a newborn and smoking weed every day ,1
right well again it sounds like you kind of recognizing that it might be time for we to leave your life again so to speak that you have goals and then perhaps that could get in the way and then you don't see that as a part of your life you know in the future so what I'm hearing also is that there's some amazing opportunity for change here and that we can work on that in the future with you so that's how good ,1
Oh Scott is semi sassy today welcome to the Hope Center for true my name is Miss Andrews and i'm here today to just kind of titled it our program and to kind of see why you're here today so for discuss warrior or our program so why don't you go ahead and tell me a little bit why are your name ,1
so it really sounds like you've had a very traumatic experience with this whole situation said you got arrested and then you had to go to court and everything was found a version ,1
um I can definitely understand how you feel like they've been singled out you know in this whole situation they were watching you feel like they are watching yeah yeah important people agreeing with these good jobs that's not good what what job do you do tell me about your job ,1
well it sounds like you really you know you really care about your job and you're very important what you do you know the vice president of this really really great company and you know you feel like this is something that other people do none of the people have company do and it just happens that you got caught this time does that kind of,1
it so it sounds like you know you really you really have a reason that you really want to be here you care about your wife can you care about your job and you really like what you do is what I'm hearing right now you're good at it look ,1
so that sounds like you you know you really care right kids in want them to see you you know in a situation like this in the future ,1
from what I'm hearing that to be getting up now that maybe you know your drinking has gotten a little bit more as you got older ,1
it seems like you know you feel like you're good dad and you're trying to provide for your kids and it sounds like you do a great job and you know stressful to have six children and you know to provide for them and be a vice president of a company i mean that's it's a lot to deal with so I mean I can understand that you know you feel like you should be able to do these things and and enjoy them and it sounds like you know you don't really know why you're here and you don't really feel like you need to be here,1
I can definitely understand where they're coming from you want to make sure that you have a job and a livelihood for your family and it sounds like you're your wife and your kids are very important to you and that is that for the reason why you're here ,1
so you have you've got you've got some health reports back and the doctor said that you had some elevated liver enzymes and so he's to be making a recommendation it's for you yeah we have quit drinking I said hell no it's not going to happen I want to quit completely he said that but you better cut back he said somebody here in should drink anything more than two glasses of whatever a night so he said cut back a little bit but that won't be a problem what I did hear you say that I thought was really great was that you said that you want to sit around for a while but you're not ready to kick the bucket that you do want to think about your health from that you do want to be here ,1
that's great i think that you know you you have a lot of really great goals what would your wife if I had your wife in your children here what would they say about your drinking,1
well in life but I'm going to come home a little early to be there on kids come on you know after school and if you go out every night with people from work then you don't get home till eight or nine o'clock at night when you get there well you typically go to bed go sleep early so they want to see me a little bit more and then of course this whole thing about going to jail ,1
you don't really want her to have to experience some of this embarrassin no she don't need to go through this ever p.m. ,1
so do you feel like you are able at this time to maybe think about you know not drinking,1
Scotty you can really see yourself in the next five years where does alcohol fit in your life at this time ,1
you make some very very good points you know if you don't have a driver's license and you don't have these things than you know it's you're not going to able to do the things that you want to do so it you know it sounds to me like you have some things you know that are very important and some reasons and some people enjoy life who could really benefit from you making a change ,1
that sounds great I mean you know they have some flavor tea center delicious set up their format balls ,1
well thank you so much for coming in today and I hope that we can we can help out yeah be back next week ,1
yeah the last time we saw things were pretty chaotic and hectic when you were being released from the hot discharged from the hospital about a week ago ,1
yeah I imagine that there's some you know a period of readjustment and healing and sadness or as in it sounds like also just trying to get things done ,1
so you're you're taking care of a lot of people your community your kids all the while trying to take care of yourself that's a lot ,1
I really appreciate you showing up today given how much you have on your plate and how much you you have going on yeah well you know last time that we met you had talked about how important it is for you to do what you can to keep your kids and yourself safe and I was wondering if you'd be interested in talking a little bit more about that today or perhaps if there's something else that you would rather talk about ,1
so so you were scared sounds like you were scared it was terrifying ,1
and when you say it was scary I hear you saying on some level was scary for you and your your safety but it also sounds like it was scary because all these other variables or elements were put in motion that were disruptive ,1
so a lot of people have some ideas about what you should be doing,1
and so say more about that say more about why you why you don't want to call the police or you don't want to get a restraining order?,1
it sounds like that was a very scary experience in moment for you ,1
and given that experience your tells like your partner maybe not as inclined to think about calling the police again ,1
and that's what you'd like to talk about today the alternatives to calling the police,1
what have you thought about so far? what other ideas do you have about? what you might do in a serious moment where you're scared?,1
okay yeah so your Minister someone that you're thinking about talking to a little bit about what's going on in your relationship what are your thoughts what would you what would you say to your Minister what would you like to tell your minister ,1
what would be some reasons why you would tell him these things what might be some advantages are reasons to do that ,1
it sounds like your pastor is able to see him as a whole complicated human being in the same ways that that you do perhaps that there's this side of him that's scary and that you don't like and then there's this other aspect of him that you you really do appreciate and and you feel like your pastor would likely be able to do that as well what would be another reason to talk to your pastor in addition to this being someone you trust and that Paul might listen to what would might be another ,1
um yeah I don't think you will so so so your pastor's home actually might be a physically safe place for you all to go ,1
so you've said that a few times now that things got so out of control and crazy tell me tell me a little bit more about how what that was ,1
and how can you do this you know what have you done ,1
so so not only was it so scary in the heat of the moment where you feared for your life and the life of your children but afterwards it was scary as well because of all the things that all that fallout yeah so so so going to your pastors talking to your pastor possibly seeing if his house might be a place that you could run to temporarily might be something to explore and those are advantages are there any disadvantages like what would be some possible disadvantages to talking to your pastor about what's been going on in your relationship that Paul will now you know if he finds out that,1
yeah so that's a little bit of a difficult situation ,1
as you think about this particular part of a safety plan on the one hand there's potential Lee some real advantages and positives to speaking to your minister and at the same time there's this possible significant risk when you think about you know the pros and the cons and in the situation what do you what do you make of that what do you where do you go with that ,1
a part of you is really worried about the next time and you appreciate that there are some risks involved in some of the safety planning and you you also feel like it's a risk that you're you're willing to take given what is at stake and really it sounds like you feel like your life and your children's lives may be at stake ,1
yeah you so you see this perhaps as a way of kind of not pulling him out of a violent situation but having him turn away from a violent situation as opposed to turn into it without when he learned done yeah he's becoming a man now too he he needs to have an option of what he can do to keep his family safe yeah and as he's becoming a man and thinking about how to protect you you're also really concerned about protecting him and gives him safe and I've heard you identify a few things that you're thinking about doing or would like to do and things that you feel like you actually do have control over I've last time we talked you you were very clear about the fact that you can't control Paul when he's in his fury in his rage and being violent and what I've heard you very clearly say that you want is to figure out what you can control you can't control him but there are some things you have control over and specifically for you that is maybe talking to a possibly a safe person you're your Minister ,1
and having that conversation to see if that might be a safe person in place to go to and and then the other pieces may be having a conversation with your oldest child at least about who to call in the moment,1
and I'm confident Vanessa that you will be able to put a plan together that will work for you and your family and I'm here to support you in any any way that I can and if it's at all helpful i'd be happy to follow up with you in a few days and see if you feel the need to talk about it some more ,1
The case just got transferred to me so I'm not very familiar with your case,1
so you're looking you're looking for a day program right and something that really was good for your daughter,1
T:  mmm yeah they were they were not not good for her you while you were there it was difficult your daughter didn't really kind of fit in or connect with anybody while you were visiting ,1
so so just there wasn't when when you visited they didn't sort of the program didn't help you to connect sir help your daughter to connect to anything that was going on that you were Just sort of viewing it ,1
I wonder if I could raise the subject of your weight what I wondered if we could spend just a couple of minutes talking about your weight you are joking Arnie,1
yeah I'm kept in your waiting room for  minutes ,1
right and so it's it's it's been a bit of a rush for you coming in ,1
and I'm sorry about the wait in the waiting well it's been it's bad form you know yeah yeah that's and that that's not easy for you because you you'd like to go really soon and Here I am asking you to spend just a couple of minutes with me ,1
it counts when you're self-employed you ain't got a choice,1
yeah I promise okay because I really must get on I want I want to simply ask you how you feel about it about what what losing weight,1
right you can see the links between your weight and your health and you'd like things to be ,1
you get on going to handle you'd like to if you could ,1
summarize what you've said and then we'll see what next and you lead a busy life yeah you run a business and you've got a lot to do yeah and you you're aware of that of the links between your health and your weight and you are concerned to some extent about that and ideally it sounds like you'd like to do something about it it's just that your life is busy and rushed and you tend to use convenience foods in order to get the work done ,1
and so if you could fit it in you would like things to be different but that's not so easy no okay can I suggest that you come back and see me in a couple of weeks time just to chat about this okay I'm up for that but it's going to be the same problem of a finding time and B if I make an appointment,1
I tell you what might be a nice solution is if you come down first appointment and I give you an appointment at  and anger then they'll be absolutely no waiting and the purpose of that of that visit will be to have a look at how you really feel about how you could move forward and somehow fit in a more healthier lifestyle into the busy work life that you've got I'll maybe have a look at my schedules see whether anything can be arranged or I can pass something on to some and and so right so it's not a wasted interview so I come here so I've looked at my schedules I've looked at things good whatever good and see if you can fix it up and also give some thought to what we've talked about yeah of course good stuff ,1
great session today Brian you're really making great improvements in all the areas that we've been focusing on you know you met all your goals that we set for you when you initially came in and I think you're just about ready to be discharged right so I'd like to take the last couple of minutes of today's session to try and make sure we carry over the results that we made in physical therapy into your daily schedule ,1
this will help keep your body strong resilience outside of the clinic so that hopefully your previous recording better back pain did not return okay so before we do this I'd like to re-explore why you saw no physical therapy in the first place ok this is sound okay to you ,1
well tell me more about the kinds of things that you were doing and why he seems to be hitting these road bumps along the way ,1
well it sounds like you really struggled it back get back into a more active lifestyle and understand how difficult it is to overcome these roadblocks and then SAT all over again so tell me everything else is going are you eating well sleeping well are there any other stressors in your life ,1
well you did have some success and you felt much better when you initially tried to become more active ,1
okay well it sounds like you realize that when you started with change these aspects of your life you felt much better and that it was going to affect your overall health but it's recurring back pain that you experienced was stopping you in your tracks so tell me what do you think that you're experiencing these recurring go to back pain in the first place ,1
I think I think your life you know pain does not necessarily mean that there's a physical problem it sometimes just means that the brain is perceiving a threat and that something needs to change there are many other things I played two white pain comes about for example how much stress you're under your productivity level much sleep you're getting your emotional health they all play a big role as well you know if one aspect of your lifestyle is not deemed healthy then it can certainly make you more sensitive to experiencing pain I think you touched on an important point earlier when you said that you didn't feel physically ready to jump back into playing pickup basketball with your friends after sitting for long periods of time throughout the day does this make sense to you ,1
we're not ready for them definitely you know because many factors influence pain we have a lot of options on how to decrease pain and make sure that it doesn't return now you're doing very well about being proactive about getting back into a more active lifestyle but i think that the physical capability of your body just wasn't there yet to jump into playing basketball with your friends at that intensity and i think that was a big reason why you experience back pain in the first place and also why it's been recurring what's your impression on that ,1
you have to think of your body is a complex ecosystem where a number of different factors mixed to create your pain you know as we touched on before things like how much stress you're under your emotional health your beliefs and aggravating activities in your case basketball they all come into play so we really don't know exactly how pain is influenced by all of these different factors but we do know that it's very helpful to address many areas of your life but as we spoke about before these factors all interrelate so when it hurts you stop exercising which changes your general wellness your mood and your social supports and so on so forth but it's important to note though that things can change you know so we can start with your activities you know what do you think that you can do in order to be more physically active but reduce the risk of the back pain returning and the additional negative effects start a company that ,1
great it sounds like we're off to a great start it's important to note though that there are many different exercises that can help you you know you need to gradually expose yourself to increasingly demanding tasks you know with start with walking let your body adapt as you've been locked tolerance you can keep moving forward so let me ask you how important is it to you to improve your consistency with exercise in order to enhance your health ,1
brilliance you've got the consistency is key you know so how how often do you think that you'll be able to exercise ,1
it sounds like a brilliant start so let me ask you on a scale of  to   being not confident at all and  being one hundred percent confident how confident are you that you would be able to stay consistent with this new exercise regime ,1
well you're not a zero that tells me you've got some conference in making a change let me ask you why are you confident ,1
okay so you realize that if you become more consistent with exercise and moving mores work you're going to feel better and you're held to be impacted positively ,1
but you're not a  that tells me that there may be some obstacles your success what would it take for you to be a  or even eight or nine,1
brilliant i get the impression that you want to stay on course and starting an exercise regime and experience in less pain the best way to do this is as we said staying consistent and setting small goals for yourself to keep motivated you know your ecosystem will adapt to be more active and you slowly begin to do more and your pain will slowly begin to subside during this progression it's important to note as well to keep slowly building up and not to put a limit on what you can do later down the road as of a bill conference and increases strength and resiliency of your body so if I saw you in two weeks what would you tell me with regards to hell your new exercise regime is going ,1
good good sounds brilliant you know so using that same scale from  to  he'll conference are you that you'll be able to stay consistent with this new exercise regime,1
last time we talked um you and Kelly had just gotten engaged and you were rather excited about plans that you had for your life so so tell me what has happened what what is what's shifted ,1
I'm sorry to hear that I know you were you're excited you were feeling hopeful for change and I don't get that same sense from you right now in fact it seems like you're feeling pretty sad and maybe even a little hopeless ,1
well how can I may how can I be helpful and supportive and useful to you right now?,1
so you're thinking about it it's not that you've committed or decided that you absolutely want to leave the relationship but correct me if I'm wrong what you're saying is you want to make a change and you don't want this relationship as it is,1
now what when you think about changing what what ideas i mean i guess you mentioned leaving what other possibilities or thoughts have you had about change and what that might look like ,1
why don't you want to be in this relationship anymore?,1
you just doesn't feel right it doesn't feel right ,1
so the way things are is not right it's not working you don't feel supported this isn't the kind of relationship that that you want or that you had hoped that it would be ,1
mm-hmm you really value your self and your well-being and in your spirit and it sounds like you don't feel like you're taking good care of yourself by staying in this relationship and even though things started out well they haven't turned out to be the kind of relationship that you want for yourself no but you know but she's lovely ,1
you're you're torn between your love and affection for her and your sense of honoring yourself and you've got a lot of mixed feelings and you are saying that you need something to change that sounds like you're able to kind of hold that complexity if you will that you've got these strong feelings for this person and you don't feel like this is the a good relationship for you know ,1
well so so then you've talked a little bit about leaving,1
tell me more about what you've thought about and when you think about making a change in terms of leaving what what might that look like for you ,1
how do you how do you extract yourself from that in a way ,1
what what thoughts do you have about how you do that how do extract yourself how might you extract yourself in a way that has some integrity and grace as you said ,1
mm-hmm I heard you say that live you know moving on and having a life without Kelly is really scary in fact it's almost impossible for you to imagine what that would look like especially with the way that your lives are so intertwined I also heard you say that the thought of not making a change is scarier and I was wondering if you could say a little bit more about what you mean by that ,1
yeah so you're concerned about your own well-being in your own joy and your your spirit if you you stay and don't make this change and that's the part that's really scary for you ,1
you mentioned that your friend suggested possibly taking a little break and you said that that was a scary thought for you and I guess I'd like to hear more our additional thoughts you might have about that as a as an option for you,1
it sounds like you're feeling like you're so in in it just so in the the mixed emotions and the sense of hopelessness and sadness and disappointment that it's really hard for you to see out of it and an advantage a reason to take a break would be just to give you a moment to breathe and look around and collect yourself and not be so stuck in that ambivalence if you will that sense of not knowing ,1
well if you don't mind I'd love to ask you to take a look at this ruler here I just kind of wrote this down really quickly but on a scale of  to   being not motivated at all and  being extremely motivated how motivated would you say you are to take a break in your relationship right now ,1
yeah well so so why I six and not a nine or ten ,1
so it's important to you and you're not maybe fully confident or sure about how the how part yeah make it home exactly well kind of following up on that on a scale of  to   not confident at all ten being extremely confident how confident are you that if you decided to take a break from relationship with Kelly you would be successful at making that happen ,1
okay so so less confident you're a little less confident than you are motivated why a three and not a zero,1
mm-hmm and so wanting it makes you feel confident that you confident to some extent that you could actually make it happen why a three and not an eight or a nine ,1
so when you think about taking this break you're also thinking about how shy she might respond and what she might do and that creates a whole other kind of set of worries and it undermines your sense of confidence on some level ,1
yeah what do you think needs to be different in order for you to feel more confident about successfully being able to take a brief break ,1
so thinking through an actual plan like what you would say how long what the boundaries are might might help you ,1
okay and then one final question on a scale of  to   being not ready at all and  being extremely ready how ready would you say you are to commit to taking some kind of brief break and that let's say the next couple of weeks,1
and and you've spoken to this already a little bit i believe but I'll ask you again why and eight and not on a one or two ,1
so your sense of readiness is actually really connected to your motivation that is that this is something you know that you need to do for yourself and if you don't things are not going to get any better and that that makes you both motivated and even more ready well why why an eight and not a  ,1
so your emotions your sense of maybe sadness and in grief and disappointment around this detract from your sense of readiness and in some way sort of giving up on a dream ,1
and so another aspect of enter your whole experience is that you're you're grieving mm-hmm the really should should be isn't even over yet but you're grieving the dream and the hopes that you had and that's a that's a heaviness and certainly a factor in and what you do next ,1
well if I could take just a moment and make sure I've captured and understood everything you've shared with me and I I know this is really difficult to talk about so I really appreciate you spending the time to share with me with with this has been like for you you've been feeling stuck and things were great for a while you had some hope that things were going to change and now you realizing that Kelly's not going to change and that you are suffering in the process that you are really being kept from your aspirations in your dreams in a lot of different regards you know that you need to make a change you want to make a change and you have a lot of mixed feelings about this change you know it's what you want to do it's the right thing for you and you still really care and love Kelly and you're also concerned kind of on an outer level about your business about your community about your family and your friends and how they may be affected by a breakup in order to make this more manageable you're thinking maybe in terms of smaller change like taking a small break as opposed to breaking off the relationship and you feel like you're pretty ready you're somewhat you know you're motivated and it may be a little less confident but you also said that if you were able to maybe think through a concrete plan that that might help you feel more confident,1
and that's certainly something that we could do together next time we meet if that's all right with you I'd be happy to hear your ideas maybe even share some suggestions with you about a possible plan that big daddy ,1
so i received the email referral from your school on your university housing office contacted me but incident you had providing alcohol I'm really glad to see you here a lot of regular referrals from what doctors offices counselors and schools of this and a lot of people are a little hesitant at first step it's a little scary so I wanna commend you for coming in here taking that first step it's awesome so what brings you today ,1
okay how many times have you seen your housing staff ,1
I'm very sorry to hear about your loss um I know it's hard to lose someone you love and so you might be using alcohol is  means to go with that how the right time processing your feelings ,1
okay so human using alcohols it means to go with your brother and I hear that you have been missing class how often will probably come to me to say to use this class and I Prime Minister's very kind to me so I'm sure that's a little bit of stress for you ,1
okay well first good job for you for paying for school on your own that's really tough I know it's really expensive so that's great and it's good thing that you're working towards education here here you trying you know it's hard to do loss so maybe you could just think of some other ways that you can like cook what the lungs how would you say the typical an eye out with your practicing ,1
it sounds like with lots of your brother and have fingers on your own and trying to maintain a good GPA with class through other ways have you seen alcohol negatively affect early ,1
so you can have a gift straight to your using alcohol to see if the stress so you can think of watching your own but not all can be pretty expensive ,1
um ok so maybe we can think of some ways that you can be stressed without alcohol um can you think of any ways that you could do that?,1
right maybe so maybe when you go out and friends you can find a way to control your is those pom-poms images ,1
well I really think your idea of working out it's a great one I know that a lot of my other clients have tried it it seems great results not only will it help me destress and but it will all be like you happy release some endorphins Fauria and i'll keep you fit so that will probably want me to shreds  C;	yeah I hope ,1
so great so you refer to me by your university housing office right off of all infraction	um you've been dealing with the loss of your brother and financial stress of school and worry about your friends so would you like ot take a few steps to take control of your key? ,1
great so in what ways would you like to do that ,1
I think that's a great plan so would you like to maybe schedule an appointment for the twisting company and there's great selfie right I will see you then Kelly,1
and so you're not too happy to be here this is the last thing that you want to be doing this afternoon ,1
all right so I can time off you it's costing you time and money ,1
so let me ask you this Bob what are some of your wife's concerns about your smoking?,1
Wow that she's been showing you and making you read ,1
so you're pretty angry about it it's pretty aging that you're forced to change your whole life ,1
so from your perspective do you see any consequences to your smoking,1
so let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario because there's a lot of pieces to it your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too so you're sort of isolated you're put in a corner you're being told this is something you have to do you have no choice in the matter well you have a few concerns about your health but that's not really the driving force it sounds like it's most of all that it would be nice if things just went back to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff wasn't something that you had to deal with anymore does that pretty much sum up?,1
it's like it's all or nothing either you keep smoking the way you are things continue to go downhill and get worse your wife gets more and more on your case or you put your cigarettes down starting the moment you walk in the door tonight and never pick them up again it's almost like one or the other it's tries to be that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to be a smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop smoking so I can actually do it that way like gradual taper there are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so abrupt recognizing that it's going to take some time and practice to get to where you might want to be,1
if you wanted to bring your wife along I'd be more than happy to talk both of you okay I hope the doctors work because their schedule changes from week to week so you work shift so I'll call you back tomorrow set something up,1
today it seems like soccer is going  great you're doing well in school and  everything is going well there's just  one more thing I wanted to talk to you  about today and I wanted to talk about  your nutrition is that okay with you?   ,1
okay great so can you tell  me what you eat in a regular day? ,1
okay great  it sounds like you're eating pretty  healthy what are you drinking with your  meals every day  ,1
and okay  how much so do you think you drink every  day? ,1
okay and how do you  feel about your soda drinking  ,1
okay  it's okay if I tell you a little bit  about soda  ,1
so each can of soda  actually has about  teaspoons of sugar  in it what do you think about that?  that's that's a lot of sugar  ,1
it is a lot  of sugar yeah so do you think maybe  drinking the soda is something you might  be interested in? ,1
okay so we're  going to work through this fit and  healthy change plan to talk about your  drinking soda and so on a scale of one  to ten how ready do you think you are to  drink less soda? ,1
okay  great it sounds like you're really  excited about drinking a soda what made  you not choose six or seven? ,1
okay great and harder question  what made you not choose a minor ten?   ,1
all you okay great so it  sounds like soft or something that's  really important to you  okay and so we talked about  changing your soda drinking how much  less soda do you think you would want to  try drinking? ,1
one can  okay that's a great star so you would  like to drink one can laugh a day and so  we're going to fill this form out  together and then I'll give you a copy  to take so that you have it so one can  last a day which is a great start  what do you think could help you make  this change? ,1
okay and some  flavorings okay that would be great so a  new water bottle and then you could get  those they have them and they don't have  any sugar in them sugar-free flavorings  which would be really great okay so what  strengths do you have that you think can  help you with this? ,1
so it  sounds like you really are concerned  about your health and you really want to  do well in soccer so that'll definitely  help you what about your family  strengths that will help you? ,1
okay that's great  so if your your mom will help you by  buying you a new water bottle and your  friends can help you buy maybe they'll  drink something different too what  things do you think can get in the way  of you being able to drink a camless of  soda a day? ,1
okay that's great so do you think  that's something you could talk to your  mom about? ,1
okay great so if your mom  put the soda some where you didn't see  it you wouldn't want to drink it as much  okay that sounds like a great idea so on  a scale of one to ten how confident are  you that you can make this change Inez?   ,1
okay great it sounds like  you're really confident and I think  you're going to do a great job drinking  less soda would it be okay if me or one  of my office nurses called to check in  and see how it's going in two weeks? ,1
okay great  so we will talk to you in two weeks and  have a great time with soccer practice   ,1
so basically what type 1 diabetes is it's a condition where our body stops production on the hormone called insulin and what influences for our body is it helps to convert food which is converted to sugar into energy for ourselves so let me show you an example let's say that this is ourselves and this is glucose so what food breaks down now our cells will need you to glucose as of energy but glucose can't get into it so it's insulin acts as a hormone open up your cells the cause of the glucose and that is how it's used for energy and this energy is what we use in everyday life like thinking talking moving things like that so without insulin your body isn't able to get the glucose into ourselves so this caused us a lot of problems so with that we have conditions like hyper let's eat yet which is what we have too much glucose in the body and that's off hypoglycemia which is what we have not and this is kind of the bounce we could try to face when it comes to type 1 diabetes so it's really important to monitor and make sure that we keep the blood glucose levels or sugar intact so do you have any questions so far?,1
okay great so did your doctor talk to you anything about insulin or taking insulin,1
okay so today we're actually going to talk about different ways that you can meet and how we can work with your diet and foods would eat with the insulin you're gonna take it so we're gonna talk about carbohydrate counting which I'll explain in a second we're also gonna talk about portion sizes come we're also gonna talk about timing and his estate meals especially when it comes to taking insulin so before we start I asked you did you forget any food items in today,1
okay awesome so when it comes to carbohydrate crowning we always want to make sure that we're aware of the carpod so if you know what a carbohydrate is,1
okay great so when it comes to carbohydrates there's also different types of carbohydrates in foods like ice cream or milk or some of our vegetables actually contain carbohydrates just sometimes not so much but they still contain a little bit some carbohydrates so let's look at this so when it comes to looking at nutrition labels we want to make sure that we're counting the total amount of carbohydrates per serving so when we account for carb exchange we like to think of 15 grams of carbohydrate equals one carb exchange and we want to make sure especially we type 1 diabetes that were laundering that especially with the influent we're taking so when it comes to 15 grams per one exchange how many carbons changes do you think are in one serving of the second cheese,1
yeah that's great that's awesome um that's exactly right and it's also good that you've rounded an off so you know kind of exact or estimates of how many cars you do so it's really good to be aware of that now is there any other foods that you brought in today,1
I'm seeing great great so based off the serving size of one cup how many karbix changes do you see,1
yeah absolutely so that's great so making sure that you're aware of that it's awesome and it's really beneficial especially we know where again how many so great I also looked at your 24-hour recall and I wrote down some items that you ate during dinner and this was the nutrition facts for them and one of them is the avocado chicken salad from Panera and the pizza field corazon you had so based on the nutrition label how many total carbs that they have for each one,1
okay great that's awesome um when it comes to the avocado chicken salad there tends to be a low amount of carbohydrates because of the vegetables but also being aware that chicken and fat don't contain any carbohydrates so it's really important for the constitute exchanges that you're aware of kind of how fat doesn't have any carbs but to gain consideration why do you think the veal parmesan has 15 grams of carbohydrate yeah that's that's awesome you made the distinction so yeah I'm just making sure when you check your salads or you're checking your meat that there's no there is if they're just start to comes out as a card exchange or you kind of do it so that's great do any questions okay great so going forward I wanna ask you a little bit about portion sizes so when it comes to portion sizes this goes hand-in-hand with carbohydrate counting does you want to know how many portion sizes you have to avoid if you're overeating or knowing coming cartilage so going with that we like to do a hand method which is about one fistful is about one cup of vegetables or rice or pasta and this is a good measurement of kind of how many carbs are so for example if you have one cup of pasta that would be three cartridges because 1/3 of a cup of pasta is what carb exchange so just being aware of that same with rice and also with vegetables it's great because 1/2 a cup is only eventual exchange but there's very little carbohydrates so you all have to really worry about how much I'm one cup of script so using the hand method is a really great way of pushing out so I wanted to ask you face off of the cereal how many this amount of cereal,1
great great that's awesome so that's a really good method you can use we also like to use again with the hand method something that you can look at is three ounces of a meat or chicken is about the size of your palm and for fat from the top of your thumb to the bottom of it is about one tablespoon so that can be considered of that exchange as well so we can go look at that so great I'm so glad that so going off of that when it comes to consume meals and timing of meals it's really important when especially when you're taking fast acting insulin because what happens is when you take insulin you're supposed to be eating 15 minutes before after you take your insulin so it to make sure that works and that you don't go into a state of hyper will say I see though cuz you're not eating any good though so it doesn't so it's really important to so I want to ask you because I know you have a really really busy day because you are working at the shop that you say yeah we work that and that normally you don't have time for breaks and stuff like that so I want to ask you what time of the day you can would be a good way to add meals or snacks to your everyday schedule,1
great great because that's actually a great record bomb great suggestion because it's really important especially because you want to make sure that your glucose cells are intact that you're eating less than four hours in between meals so a lot of times people tend to eat either three big meals or they tend to eat six small meals so whatever you want you choose that go as well with your work schedule totally up to you just making sure that you're monitoring it and making sure you're taking it with your insulin before time so going with that I wanted to ask you at four o'clock so what kind of needles are doing at that time because that's really,1
okay um it's not a realistic goal for you do you think you will have trying to eat that's not during that period of time,1
okay absolutely so when it comes to bananas this is specially really important roots are also considered a carbohydrate exchange about 1/2 a cup and we time to think of a banana one full exchange so just letting you know that a half a cup which is about a half a banana it's one carbon straight so if you're eating one full banana it's considered to carb exchanges but throughout this whole process you'll learn a lot about different kinds of exchanges and how to tell which one some people get really really good at it so and if you have any questions you go that way so going on is there any other areas of improvement you would like to do for snacking or anything like that,1
okay so where's another time of day where you would like to add back,1
okay and what kind of sweets do you like to eat during that time or like in the morning,1
okay so would you like to have what kind of snacks would you like two halves would you like I like to have a little vegetables or what are you looking for when it comes ideally,1
okay and I have a quick quiz for you what does fifteen grams of carbohydrates equal,1
correct that's awesome I'm really excited to work with you but I also have this great information about type one diabetes so it will tell you about different kinds of carbohydrates are considered like breads what we're talking about that milk fruit and sweets also why it's important and also there's a little list over here which is a food journal that you can use so for the next few days or the next month I would really like for you to see what kind of changes you're making and what kind of goals you would like to set to move forward especially when it comes to your meals so just write them down and I plan to meet with you in about a month so we can talk about your,1
hi John nice to see you again so tell me how are things going ,1
well I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront do you mind if we explore this issue further ,1
well it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently and I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have to come back again so tell me what you did to lose that initial  pounds ,1
but you did have some success tell me how you felt when you lost the weight ,1
well it sounds like you realize that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's going to affect your overall health so tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back well,1
and how many servings are fruits and vegetables on average per day would you,1
John is very important that you recognize that some fruits but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola ,1
you're absolutely right but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only when it comes to nutrition we have to have a more personalized approach so I have a hunch and that is the excess fruit that you are consuming probably caused your weight rebound what's your impression ,1
let me ask you something knowing what you know now how important is it to to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking ,1
I understand let me ask you this on a scale from zero to ten zero mean that there's no way you can do it and ten meaning that you're % confidence that you can do it how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking ,1
all right so you're not a zero so that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable this is something you certainly can do why are you not a zero ,1
so you realize again that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in you're going to decrease your weight you're going to feel better and you're going to impact your health positively ,1
but you're also not a ten and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success what would it take for you to be a ten or even an eight or nine ,1
okay now if the juice was still there can you think of anything else you could do I suppose I could replace it with low-calorie drink or drink more water excellent ,1
John I get the impression that you want to stay in course with weight reduction and the best way to do this will be to decrease the amount of juice that you're currently taking in so if I saw you in two weeks and I asked you how much juice you're drinking and how you did it what would you tell me ,1
excellent well it sounds like you have a plan same scale zero to ten how confident are you that you can make this happen okay I agree all right well you know what I'm not going to start any medications today your labs were a little bit off but I think we can handle this from a purely lifestyle standpoint what do you think great sounds good to me excellent I'll see you in two weeks you  ,1
hi-oh Vina how are you doing today it's good to see you,1
you know we did some pre-visit planning with you and your phq-2 which is a short depression screen was actually positive so we asked the nurse to give you a little longer screening tool which is a phq-9 and that actually did come up with a score of 8 which is in the mild depression range so how does that how does that feel,1
tell me a little bit more about not feeling like yourself,1
so you sleep a lot but even though you're sleeping you don't wake up rested,1
yeah I can see where that would be bothersome to you what else what else is going on with you,1
that's particularly hard when those anniversaries come around for the passings of our parents that's a that's a very difficult time I,1
I'm really sorry for your loss and thank you for sharing that with me I know that's I know that's very difficult so it sounds like your sleep has really been affected you're not getting good quality sleep you're really fatigued,1
just kind of going through the motions it sounds like during the day and then how's your appetite been,1
so you used to be more socially involved than you are now,1
so if there was something that you could do about this what do you think you might like to do,1
it's kind of the same old routine um I wonder if it would be okay if we could talk about some of the options that are out there for folks that have some mild depression,1
like you would that be alright most of the time we typically think about medication as a as a possible answer so no medication at this point,1
all right then I think as important certainly perhaps more important than medication is counseling and getting you to talk with someone about your feelings on a regular basis and getting some feedback on that,1
sure something else might be exercise another possibility would be a natural product there are some things over the counter that I think for mild depression may be appropriate and those that's another thing that we could talk about if you wanted to learn a little bit more about those,1
okay if it's okay let's go back to talking about the counseling for a minute and then we can hit some of those other things too,1
so um is there a counselor that you know or that you have a relationship with this lady that worked with you during your mom's death is she someone who's out in the community,1
it sounds like you're pretty ready to do that could you say on a scale of zero to ten ten being really ready zero being not ready at all how ready would you be to do some counselling,1
so it sounds like you've got a connection there already that's really good,1
um does that sound like something you're ready to do then and maybe make a plan about that,1
well that's okay then it would be all right if we talked a little bit about the exercise I know you said that didn't really sound like an option for you at this time and that's perfectly fine only you can make those decisions Alvina but if it's okay I wanted to give you a little bit of information about exercise and its effect on the brain,1
exercises is again a number of studies has been shown to be as effective as prescription antidepressants,1
yeah it actually raises serotonin have you heard about serotonin,1
It's kind of the happy hormone yes so um it actually raises serotonin and also something called BDNF which is well it doesn't really matter what it is but it helps actually your your brain actually grow and help repair itself so exercise can help in lots of ways by improving serotonin and decreasing stress certainly and in actually improving the quality of sleep how does that sound at this point,1
absolutely again those are yours to sit your decisions and I'm I'm here to really support you in those so if those sound like things that you might be willing to do I'm I'm all for it,1
so you have some friends that are already involved in an exercise program,1
is that something you talk with them about and that you possibly could get into that group,1
so it sounds like a wide variety of things that you could do,1
very good well I think it sounds like this is important for you to to feel better and it sounds like you're really ready to kind of make a plan how do you see this fitting into your life at this point again kind of getting back to the counseling and and the exercise,1
let's talk a little bit more about that you're say on a scale of if we can do use another one of those scales zero being confident that you could start an exercise program zero being not very confident at all in 10 being very confident tell me where you are in this exercise thing,1
okay that sounds like a pretty strong commitment,1
okay and tell me a little bit more about your plan for exercise at this point then,1
I think that's a great decision you have a couple of friends in mind that you could call,1
so tell me how to tell me about a plan that you would think could perhaps get you going with with the exercise,1
so it would be difficult to do it in the morning you don't see that happening,1
you think it would be easier to do it after work,1
all right well good it sounds like we have a plan for the counselor and when you check out today I will put this in your record and that will want to get in touch with the counselor that you work with when your mom was going through,1
her passing in the grief situation and then I'll want to depend upon you to call your friends and then get involved in the exercise program,1
all right and if it's okay I'd like to call you in a week to one see how you're feeling and to the exercise is helping you may really find that after you give the exercise a good trial you may actually look forward to it because my hope is that will actually help you feel better and improve your mood and then I would also like to see you back in two weeks just to check on things now we've talked about exercise apartment we've talked about medication not being on the table at this point but I want you to know you know you can call anytime and I will work to get you in and that might be something that we need to do if our plan is not working,1
hi this Bravo I'm hear it and I'm nurse practitioner today how are you doing not that great I could be better Foreman seen here today ,1
I noticed from your previous physical exam couple days ago that your blood pressure seems to be a little bit high it was around  over  and I was wondering how you are managing this blood pressure or are you aware of your hypertension ,1
okay well thank you for seeing me today I understand that you have concerns about your blood pressure can you please tell me more about it ,1
okay it seems to me that you're really concerned about your blood pressure and that you are willing to change if I'm understanding this correctly you are not aware of any side effects of your medication and your water pill makes you go to the washroom a lot which makes you not want to take your medication even more also you mentioned that you are living alone and so you tend to forget your pills and you would want some help to remember that is this correct ,1
well thank you for sharing this information with me and for your honesty since both of us are aware that this is an issue would it be okay to talk about your hypertension and what it means to you yeah okay to start would you mind describing some at disadvantages of your hypertension so that we can see you may have ,1
okay well I just shut down some of the concerns that you mentioned just so super clear that we have it here and it seems to me that your biggest concern is your medication adherence and that is pretty much affecting like your daily activities such as going to get exercise or preparing a meal is this right yeah that's right okay now that we've identified some of the challenges we cannot can we please identify some of the advantages of you take your medication properly ,1
okay that's awesome um when it comes to the importance of you taking your medication on a scale from  to   being unimportant  the most important how important is it to you for you to take this medication ,1
now that this issue is very important to you I would like to know how confident you are in achieving this goal so again on a scale from  to   King unconfident and  the most confident how confident are you that you are able to take your medication regularly ,1
ok what would it take for you to go from an  or above or even a  out of  for your confidence ,1
ok thank you for that let me see if I'm understanding this correctly you're aware that you have hypertension and you truly want to manage your blood pressure but you're unable to do so because there are certain challenges that you face such as you can diet for getting your pills regularly not being able to monitor your blood pressure but this leads you to not seeing the full effect of the medication itself however you are so confident that you're able to change by let's say going to a followup with me or having support from your families or friends am I,1
ok it seems like you are willing to change your behavior and at the same time you are frustrated about not getting the medication that you need for you to change or support that you need to change am I is a spread,1
ok do you have any ideas on how to achieve this goal ,1
um I'm wondering if you are able to or you'll be open to your monitoring your blood pressure for the safe and next couple of months um just monitoring and see if that side effects are there or if it's working for you this way we can evaluate whether the medication is right for you this time this is ok ,1
if you want I can give you some information about like new medications and if you have any questions don't hesitate to give me a call also for the next appointment that we're going to have if you can bring your your diary where you write your blood pressure down we can see and track down how is the medication is for you is there anything else I can do for you ,1
hi Hannah nice to meet you hi so I understand that you were referred to me by your GP because you've been experiencing some anxiety difficulties,1
okay is this the first time that you've left home,1
okay so it's been quite a big step in a big change and and it sounds like that that was what led you to go to your GP,1
okay so we'd be a little bit anxious about today,1
okay so I guess just going back to and why you went to the GP and how you've ended up kind of coming here today so it sounds like you've been experiencing anxiety for quite a few years but just recently moved out of home for the first time,1
and that was what kind of led you to go to the GP so how did that change things how were things after you moved out and,1
okay so what other kind of difficulties that you have been experiencing,1
O'Casey said that your difficulties are getting in the way of you doing certain things so they're they're stopping you from taking up kind of certain types of work and as a freelance photographer I guess that that can be kind of a problem and they're also stopping you or you feel like it is stunting you socially you're not kind of able to make new friends and get to meet new people,1
see kind of worried about how where this is going to lead to,1
so you said that you first noticed the anxiety kicking in when about five or six years ago so you would have been about 19 yeah and what was happening around that time,1
what kind of work is the most difficult for you am your job,1
so I has tell me a bit more about what happens then so let's focus on maybe an invitation to do a job with you know it's going to involve photography with with a group of people and you're going to have to have social interaction what kind of thoughts go through your head,1
okay so it sounds like you have quite a lot of thoughts rushing through your head then at another point where you get that invitation you think people look people stare people will think I'm a weirdo there's quite a lot about what what you think other people will think,1
okay can you give me an example of a recent situation maybe we can focus on that,1
yeah time when you may be doing a job with some people and you've got the social anxiety you know that you're describing about that kick in,1
that sounds quite interesting was that a fashion shoot,1
so how long ago was that that was two weeks ago,1
just felt really just really kind of heart I couldn't really breathe and just felt like I wanted to just get out and I was kind of trying really really hard to just focus and just you know like kind of hold the camera and just not think about anything but I just felt like everyone was looking at me and like when they'd say action and they'd try and get me to start and I was just felt like everyone was just thinking I was really stupid and I shouldn't have been there and,1
and why was that why was that helpful because I felt like I was getting really like hot and flushed and I just though at least if I can just I don't know it sounds weird but I was just trying to keep my hands still on it because my hands are kind of sweaty and like shaking like loads like and I could just tell everyone was looking and they could see and I just thought if I just managed to hold on to it it wouldn't be as noticeable but,1
just I was just just stupid and was just really just felt really like a kind of like everyone was just going to be staring and just thinking that I just felt like everyone was looking at me and just they could tell and just thinking or what what's she doing and,1
that I was just really like sweaty and just so fat,1
yeah yeah and I was trying to wear black so this kind of tries to cover it up and just like a lot of layers so they can't tell but I mean my hands like they was so shaking I was really red and just was just wishing that I just wasn't there,1
I think just really stupid and like I think my face was really red I could feel it flushing and I knew vow'd was probably sweating and shaking like my hands were definitely really really shaking and and ever it was like definitely really noticeable everyone could definitely stay,1
well again I was trying to grip the camera just look down just trying not to do anything weird or because I mean that they could probably tell I was being weird anyway but hopefully if I just tried really hard to just focus and look down not try it like not look at anyone else and just yeah just kind of try and get on with it as best as I could but,1
great session today Brian you're really making great improvements in all the areas that we've been focusing on you know you've met all your goals that we set for you when you initially came in and I think you're just about ready to be discharged great so I'd like to take the last couple of minutes of today's session to try and make sure we carry over the results that we made in physical therapy into your daily schedule,1
this will help keep your body strong resilience outside of the clinic so that hopefully your previous recording there's a back pain do not return okay so before we do this I'd like to read explore why you sought out physical therapy in the first place okay does it sound okay to you,1
okay well tell me more about the kinds of things that you were doing and why he seems to be hitting these road bumps along the way,1
well it sounds like you you've really struggled that back get back into a more active lifestyle and understand how difficult it is to overcome these roadblocks and INSAT all over again so tell me everything else is going are you eating well sleeping well are there any other stressors in your life,1
well you did have some success and you felt much better when you initially tried to become more active,1
okay well it sounds like you realized that when you started to change these aspects of your life you felt much better and that it was going to affect your overall health but it's recurring back pain that you experienced was stopping you in your tracks so tell me what do you think that you're experiencing these recurring bouts of back pain in the first place,1
I think I think you're right you know pain does not necessarily mean that there's a physical problem it sometimes just means that the brain is perceiving a stress and that something needs to change there are many other things that play into why pain comes about for example how much stress you're under your productivity level much sleep you're getting your emotional health they all play a big role as well you know if one aspect of your lifestyle is not deemed healthy then it can certainly make you more sensitive to experiencing pain I think you touched on an important point earlier when you said that you didn't feel physically ready to jump back into playing pick-up basketball with your friends after sitting for long periods of time throughout the day does this make sense to you,1
definitely not ready for that definitely you know because many factors influence we have a lot of options on how to decrease pain and make sure that it doesn't return now you're doing very well about being proactive about getting back into a more active lifestyle but I think that the physical capability good body just wasn't there yet to jump into playing basketball with your friends at that intensity and I think that was a big reason why you experience back pain in the first place and also why it's been recurring what's your impression on that,1
you have to think of your body is a complex ecosystem where a number of different factors mixed to create your pain you know as we touched on before things like how much stress you're under your emotional health your beliefs and aggravating activities in your case basketball they all come into play so we really don't know exactly how pain is influenced by all of these different factors but we do know that it's very helpful to address many areas of your life but as we spoke about before these factors all interrelate so when it hurts you stop exercising which changes your general wellness your mood and your social supports and so on and so forth but it's important to note though that things can change you know so we can start with your activities you know what do you think that you can do in order to be more physically active but reduce the risk of the back pain returning and the additional negative effects that accompany that,1
great it sounds like we're off to a great start it's important to note though that there are many different exercises that can help you you know you need to gradually expose yourself to increasingly demanding tasks you know we start with walking let your body adapt as you have been locked tolerance you can keep moving forward so let me ask you how important is it to you to improve your consistency with exercise in order to enhance your health,1
brilliant you've got it consistency is key you know so how how often do you think that you'll be able to exercise,1
sounds like a brilliant start so let me ask you on a scale of zero to ten zero being not confident at all and ten being 100% confident how confident are you that you will be able to stay consistent with this new exercise regime,1
but you're not a zero that tells me you've got some confidence in making a change so let me ask you why are you confident you know,1
okay so you realize that if you become more consistent with exercise and moving Moore's work you're going to feel better and you're held to be impacted positively,1
but you're not a 10 that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success what would it take for you to be a 10 or even an eight or a nine,1
brilliant I get the impression that you want to stay on course with starting an exercise regime and experience in less pain the best way to do this is as we said staying consistent and setting small goals for yourself to keep motivated you know your ecosystem will adapt to be more active and you slowly begin to do more and your pain will slowly begin to subside during this progression it's important to note as well to keep slowly building up and not to put a limit on what you can do later down the road as I sort of build confidence and increase the strength and resiliency of your body so if I saw you in two weeks what would you tell me with regards to hell your new exercise regime is going,1
good good sounds brilliant you know so using that same scale from zero to ten how confident are you that you'll be able to stay consistent with this new exercise regime,1
I agree you know overall most comments in your brain let's see you in two weeks crazy idea,1
hello there my name is dr. Bedi I'm one of the new GPS in the practice first of all what would you like me to call you,1
okay that's fine okay so Barbara I'm seeing you today but I think it',1
yes dr. Brown's my doctor okay what is it that's brought you to see me today,1
right okay can you tell me a bit more about your tummy problems,1
so quite a few symptoms there and some of them sound quite troublesome to you,1
mm-hmm okay okay so you think it began about four years ago after this holiday,1
okay and what what sort of treatments have you tried for this before,1
so these different tablets that you've got from the the herbal shop how are you taking them,1
so my am i right in thinking you perhaps decide on a day-to-day basis and what you're going to take demanding of what your stomach's doing,1
okay okay and what about tests have you had any tests for these problems,1
right sounds as though you're not happy with that,1
so you feel as though actually enough hasn't been done in the way of,1
right okay it sounds like you've had these problems now for about four years you've got a lot of various symptoms in your stomach you've tried a lot of tablets some prescribed some herbal remedies and you've had some investigations but you're not entirely happy that you even been investigated thoroughly enough is that is that about a toast if I got the story right okay and can ask you Barbara how is all of this affecting you day to day how has it affecting your life,1
yeah it does it does sound as though over the last few years your life has really changed quite a lot because of these symptoms it sounds like you're doing the review of the things that you used to do,1
right what is it you'd spend your average day doing now,1
right okay okay and have there been any times over the last four years that you've noticed any significant changes in your symptoms for example have there been any times when things have been better for you,1
nice sounds good right that's interesting hmm and are there any times when you Tommy symptoms bother you more it seemed particularly bad,1
notice it they're worse when your husband's not around mmm,1
right I know you've been seeing dr. Brown about this for the last few years what is it that he's said that he thinks might be wrong with you,1
mm-hmm and have you had any thoughts yourself about what you think might be causing it,1
so you're kind of prodding having a feel at night oh you see if you can feel anything,1
right okay okay so just to make sure that I've got the story straight you've you've seen dr. Brown for a couple of years you've you've tried a variety of medications some prescribed some from the herbal shop and none of them really made a great deal of difference you've had some investigations but you're perhaps feeling you've not had enough investigations and times you worried that this could be something quite serious like a cancer is that have I got a story right,1
okay Bob well what was it that you were hoping that I'd do for you today,1
right right so you were hoping that I'd send you for more tests,1
right okay well I think Barbara having having heard your story and heard about the symptoms I'm not sure that actually sending you for more tests at this point would be the most useful thing that we could do for you and the reason for that is because you've you've had some of the main investigations in the last couple of years and they've not shown anything and your symptoms haven't really changed that much so it's very unlikely that if we were to send you for more tests now that they'd show anything different than what we already know so it would be I think it would be a waste of time for you to go for more tests,1
no I think that you clearly have pain and clearly you have lots of physical symptoms and they're clearly getting in the way of your life causing you a lot of disability I guess I guess the way I think about these things is that they're not necessarily either all in the mind or all in the body sometimes these things can go together I guess I'm thinking about how you told me that last year when your son got married and you were very busy and quite happy that somehow your symptoms seemed less and then when your husband's away which is something you don't like very much sometimes somehow is your symptoms then will seem greater so I guess what I'm wondering Barbara is if there might be some kind of a link with you between how you're feeling in your mind and what's going on in your life and and how much you symptoms trouble you do you think that's a possibility,1
I'm not saying that the pains in your mind I guess what I'm saying is that sometimes the way that we feel and the way that our lives are going can impact how we notice our symptoms given that we've tried medication for you and we've tried investigations and we've drawn a blank really with those none of those have really helped you I guess I'm wondering whether now it would be a good idea to try a different approach to your problems,1
well I guess thinking a little bit about those other areas of your life I'm thinking about the fact that over the last four years your life has really changed it seems to have really shrunk down and it sounds as though you're not doing lots of the things that you used to do that you used to get pleasure out of is that right,1
and I guess I wonder it sounds as though you've you've dropped doing those things because you felt you couldn't do them but I wonder if in a funny way what's happened is the fact that you're not doing those pleasurable things now has kind of fed into you feeling unhappy with the way that that your life is at the moment and I guess I wonder whether that can then make your symptoms worse for you,1
I guess what I'd be wondering is whether one of the approaches we need to be using now is thinking about what you do with your life and what you do with your day and maybe trying to bring back some of those pleasurable things you know even if it's just meeting up with your female friends once a week and whether actually doing those sorts of things might generally improve your quality of life I'm also thinking about the tablets that you're taking and the fact that you you seem to be taking quite a lot of them and wondering whether it's worth for sitting and looking at them and maybe trying to rationalize them a little bit and really decide which are helping you which are doing nothing and which may actually be making some of your symptoms worse I guess,1
what would you think about trying that slightly different approach for say two or three months just to see whether or not it makes any difference,1
well I guess if we if we did decide to work together like this in this new approach I'd be seeing you regularly we can keep an eye on your symptoms and if they change then we can investigate as appropriate but if they stay the same then you know we could be pretty clear that there's nothing new happening that that we're missing now would that sound,1
I think that would be a good idea I think we've only just begun to talk about it and I think perhaps you need to have a bit of time to think about it and then perhaps come back perhaps if you booked in for a double slot next week and that would give us a good chunk of time to think about this new approach and perhaps if you could also bring your your tablets in or make a list of them we can look at what you're taking and perhaps go from there how would that sound Barbara,1
yes I think so I think that would be a good a good start,1
okay all right okay all right so shows thank you again next week,1
so I noticed on your diary car that you have that you did cut,1
okay so let's talk about that a little bit when what day did that happen on,1
Tuesday okay so where were you on Tuesday when you first had the thought that you wanted to cut,1
okay see you were standing at your locker and you heard somebody say something about Tim that you didn't want to hear,1
on a scale of one to ten how angry would you say you were,1
what did you do like then you're at your locker what's the next thing you did after you heard it the,1
so I know that the gym is usually the place where he cut because you said you can go behind the bleachers people don't usually see you there,1
okay so where between hearing the person talking about Tim and going to the gym where did you decide to cut because you said you were also feeling like punching somebody so there must have been a point where you decided I'm going to cut,1
okay so that was when you decided to cut and you went down to the gym,1
okay that was a pencil that you were saying that you were going to get rid of,1
okay so you still had the pencil you got under the bleachers you say you were feeling angry still are you still on the scale of one to ten where were you when you got under the bleachers,1
how deep did you cut where it was it deep enough that you needed a band-aid did you need more than a band-aid,1
but it wasn't so deep that you needed something more,1
okay right after you cut where were you on the scale of one to ten with your feeling with your anger like a,1
did that feeling last you for the rest of the day they're feeling better um yeah for the most part yeah did,1
I kind of forgot about it okay but then I just started thinking about it again right before bad and just feeling really guilty that I cut because I knew I was going to have to talk about it with you and I just I mean I the night time I just I constantly think about what happened that day and then what the next day is going to be like I mean you know it's usually a pretty hard time,1
so you were thinking back it up back on it then and you were feeling guilty,1
sounds like you weren't feeling so good about it then as you were in the afternoon,1
sounds like for you cutting works for a little while but it doesn't last,1
I know you've also been working on doing less cutting,1
you have you've been working really hard I'm just wondering if we can find something that might last that you can feel good about later that you won't have those guilty feelings,1
okay so with the cutting it sounds like the point where you decided to cut at your locker what triggered it was hearing that girl talking about Tim,1
okay it sounds like you're also already having a pretty bad day you said he hadn't called he hadn't been texting as much and that was on your mind,1
so I'm wondering if at that point if we can think of two things that you can try differently next time instead of the cutting,1
that'll bring that anger from a nine down a little bit,1
it might not but it'll bring it down a little bit maybe each thing you try brings it down a little bit more,1
maybe there'll be things you'll feel good about later you won't have to worry about that guilty feeling coming back,1
so the first thing is that pencil it sounds like it's comforting to have it,1
it also sounds like it's tempting what do you think about that,1
having that pencil is going to make it harder to try other things and you've been talking about how you're really committed to not cutting any more or cutting less,1
what do you think about getting rid of the pencil this time choosing a different favorite pencil but maybe you can't cut with,1
that way you can still have something that can be your favorite but which won't tempt you that'll make it easier to try the two things,1
okay what do you think our first thing should be what do you think you can try you just heard somebody say something you don't want to hear you're feeling pretty angry what can you do in that moment,1
is that something you'd be willing to try next time,1
okay that sounds like a good one to try so we have headphones I need to come up with one more what do you think you'd like to try,1
that sounds like a good option so that's our goal is to keep pushing cutting further down the list and to keep adding things that you're going to try first and you're right that the first thing you try might not bring you all the way down to a two or of three but it might bring you down a little bit and each thing you try might bring you down just a little bit more so you have to be willing to try a few things can you do that,1
okay thank you for answering all my questions on this you did a great job with this chain and I know it wasn't easy,1
you Rachel it hurt coming today what brings you in,1
so there's been some big things going on your life that's really prompted your push for weight loss so I just want to check it really quick and so on a scale of one to ten with one being really super important and have to do it starting today where are you in turn taken away,1
okay bad idea on in that same scale with one being not confident at all to 10 being super super confident where would you say your are in terms of your confidence to actually lose the way,1
and what what promise you to pick a five or six,1
okay so what can we do to get you at say like a nine or ten level of confidence,1
hi my name is Laura I'm the pharmacist let me just look you up in the computer,1
and then you are using the unplanned when you feel like your blood sugars are running high,1
and how do you feel your implants working for that,1
do you feel like you've seen some real improvements on that,1
okay so tell me why you're only using it when your blood sugar goes high,1
so you were experiencing some pain who knows what I'd like you to kind of use it a little left off,1
and you feel like that's really impacting your day,1
okay so sounds like you've seen some improvement your blood Sugar's have been sometimes under control what have you discuss with your doctor recently,1
well you're here today for the refill and it seems like you're really committed to getting your blood Sugar's under control,1
there are some options that we could discuss about how to reduce pain when you inject,1
there are also some suggestions that I could make about how to keep your blood Sugar's under control best,1
Jeffrey tell me what you'd like to talk about today,1
okay so right now you have so much going on that you're just feeling totally overwhelmed you don't even know where to start,1
thinking about trying to control your diabetes just seems like one more,1
here you've been feeling a little bit depressed right now,1
so it sounds like you mentioned that you had been going to church some like the people that you had,1
yeah exactly yeah in two in two of them had diabetes as well so sometimes we were just Chad you know see you people were you know just taking care of themselves get into the clinic doing whatever they needed to do so,1
it sounds a little bit like you're feeling a change that you can't fill this role that you,1
you're really frustrated because there's so many things going on in your life that you feel like you don't even have control,1
so in the past when you were able to have the structure and also the support of people around you it's sort of added more daily basis there's a lot easier,1
okay so you know you're really overwhelmed right now and everything just sort of really it sounds like you may have identified a few things to think about in trying to figure out where to move forward I did work in the past,1
so having some social support having some structure,1
good morning Linda my name is Ann and I'll be your next to do yeah we have about 15 minutes where we could talk and I want you to know that whatever information you give me will be kept confidential and I'm only going to inform the health care team if needed yeah I actually am happy and respect the fact that you took of time off your busy schedule so come and see me today how are you feeling so what I think you are a little bit concerned right can you elaborate on that,1
so what I'm hearing you say is it's really been hard it's really been difficult for you to exercise this data right yes,1
so what you're saying is you tried some strategies in the past but it didn't work out as planned this well I want you to know that relapse is normal and changing a behavior it's also quite as difficult it takes time so do not be too hard on himself but I appreciate the fact that you actually do try and that is a good step you did actually take so why do you want to change,1
okay so on a scale of 0 to 10 there will be not important at all and 10 being very important how do you reach the level of importance of,1
okay great that's wonderful so that tells me that it's actually very important to you right okay then on a scale of zero to ten again there being not that confident on not having any confidence in yourself and ten being very confident in yourself how would you reach your confidence level for changing to start to exercise so that's also good but can you explain to me why it's actually not informative,1
okay okay so what do you think I've helped you move towards the -,1
well so Linda what I'm hearing you say is that it's actually very important for you to exercise but on the other hand you are not that confidence to actually start a success is that true,1
okay well so far I don't know a few things about you can you tell me how it typically is like for you,1
so what you're telling me is that on one hand you are very busy with your job but on the other hand you take place right and actually that's a good thing because we can actually capitalize upon taking your brakes have you ever thought of ways in which you could use your groups it's Eliza we've done,1
oh great that's really wonderful to hear from you can I share a few thoughts with you,1
eyesight actually going to the gym or when you don't have the opportunity to go to the gym you can also use the stay keys instead of using the elevator,1
yeah that would also provide a means of being physically active okay what do you think,1
okay so since I'm gonna see you back in two minutes in two weeks sorry I would like you to actually notes when you actually go to the gym and also when you use the staircase and bring it back write it down in your journal and would know the next step from there okay thank you,1
well Jessica once we tell me what brings you here today,1
so sometimes you're stressed because your son's how's his health issues,1
okay sounds like email about it sometime relationship with his father you feel is 50 leaving the relationship will be damaged it someone,1
yeah and said I mean that's what I'm Stefan is that do I stay with him and even though I'm unhappy and even though he's not being emotionally supportive for me so that he could have that relationship with my son or do I leave him and possibly hurt their relationship but by a find better support for myself,1
yeah and he's um he's hidden danone considering leaving him I mean I started it in the past but he just always ignored it and just blow it all I child leaving him before but I never was able to do it for more than a couple of days hey this is my hair I mean or like with the parenting thing I want to get there I'll me get better but it never happens so what's up a lot of fun,1
yeah and so that's why it because they give you more depressed is that I'm just stuck and I don't I don't know what to do instead become go stalking approach,1
I mean it's just I'm crying all the time I'm all happy i'm feeling so overwhelmed with everything i'm having to do and i'm getting a lot of stress for my parents because they're having to help out a lot because he's slacking they build that since I married that he should be helping me financially it should be helping me words against and that she's not happening,1
yeah it's just it's causing a hard the conflict in my life and I just never know it she's making me really happy sounds back around doing nothing everyone i am basically doing the same routine besides going to take my son to all the doctor visits and hospital visits I have no friends because I don't have any time to myself because I'm basically a single parent even if someone else's in the household I I'm not I don't have anything to do outside of the house and I hard time,1
yeah yeah I know I'm the annoying if we weren't together my family would be more helpful you know they even offer me any support if I just leave you know that I could live a diff and that would help me with the boys but for now you know they're kind of saying it as he is to step up since he's the one I'm living with it is just not happening and I'm always stressed as well about money because he's he's not providing adequate finances for our family there's times where hundreds and hundreds dollars go missing him off them here's no idea where it's gone too and that's very stressful so all so much for the money,1
so you know um I guess to figure out where i'm going to say my parents had offered her place i have a couple friends who offered a lot of jobs so i would have to stay with somebody else,1
I would I mean right now I'm I feel like I'm not ready to do that to take that except I feel like I'm scary at first steps best food we've been comfortable with yeah and I don't want to have to explain to a child you know why mommy her mommy both boys are moving to make plays,1
yeah yeah and i don't mean I values the love moments into I don't want to it makes me sad to think that I feel me more like you know like my husband anymore if I do that ok you may not we may not be able to work it out if I go through you know how am I actually and that's splitting up so it's scary soon over i watch mr. bone switch your family yeah and it's um it's worrisome picking their steps so I'm so far the probe,1
yeah yeah I'm just really stuck between the two yarders don't know where I'm going to go from here I'm really telling martin's right now but I know that I really don't be sad,1
I'm doing great things now we have about 15 minutes today and I want to make sure that we talk about what's important to you however I do want to take some time at the beginning to talk about your recent lab work would that be okay,1
the blood sugars have increased some so you're concerned that things are not as good as they were last time that we talked,1
right why I'd certainly didn't mean to startle you but there has been a significant increase in your that a1c that three-month average on your blood sugar yeah so that's gone from you've been doing so great we'd brought it down from over 9 to about 7.5 and now it's kind of bounced back up to 8.4 and I'm wondering if you had any ideas as to why that might have happened,1
um telling me would have been great but that's okay I mean you had a concern about a medication that you dread some things about and you stopped the medication I think that's a good thing that's a good decision,1
so the concern of cancer was probably the main thing that me,1
so quite a bit of nausea the diarrhea and then you also have that fear of cancer,1
tell me what you know about the consequences of having high blood sugars that are untreated,1
so on the one hand there are some things that really scare you about having diabetes that's uncontrolled and on the other hand it's been difficult for you I know we've talked in the past about working on controlling your your diet and looking at your way so where does that leave you at this point,1
so those types of sweets and crunchy stuff and salty stuff is is pretty important to you,1
so some of the problems you've had in the past you've had some failures you you've tried something tummy tell me a little bit more about some of the things that you've tried already,1
so you felt fatigued and somewhat depressed while you were on the Atkins diet that's something I hear not yeah pretty it's pretty often I think that if it's okay we could talk about that for a minute if that's something,1
so carbohydrates actually do make us feel better they actually raise something called serotonin,1
asked kind of a happy horn but yeah so as we do eat simple carbohydrates in particular those rays are our serotonin levels so that we actually do feel better and so some people on the Atkins diet actually do feel depressed and fatigued because their your serotonin levels aren't as high but that can be a dangerous cycle because as we raise our blood sugar you know we feel good if it's as if it's a simple sugar though blood sugar goes up insulin goes up we tend to crash we tend to eat more which tends to do the cycle of carbohydrate cravings,1
yeah so um what sort of things can you think about that could maybe calm those blood sugar swings down,1
sounds like there's a lot of emotional investment for you and your family around food that can make things more difficult and that those may be some barriers that we need to talk about if it's okay would it be alright if we talked a little bit more about some of the other low carb diets that are out there,1
and what do you know about low carb diets can you you know if any that come to mind,1
there are there's a couple out there one called protein power and but a lot of my patients have had a lot of luck with South Beach diet wouldn't be already I'm,1
well early on in the South Beach the first two weeks is called phase one and that's a very low carb time but during that time carbohydrate cravings people tell me typically really really calm down but even in that first phase in South Beach you can have again healthy salads and healthy carbohydrates then you kind of build on up and even in level two there are some actually healthy cookie recipes,1
so in a limited state we may be able to give you some of your cookies back mmm so shown,1
so on a scale of zero to ten ten being really ready to make a change zero being really not ready at all where do you think you are at this point,1
that sounds like you're fairly ready to do something that's good and how do you think will deal with some of these carbohydrate cravings,1
right okay so one of the great things about South Beach is I think it's for $7.99 a month or something like that you can get tied in and have your own registered dietician did you have regular appointments with,1
yeah and they can help you through recipes and and also give you some strategies on the carbohydrate cravings so does that make sense,1
okay well you're you're obviously a very inquisitive and intelligent lady and I think you'll have good success with this the other thing that we can offer is we do have a weight management support group here at the practice that meets on a weekly basis and I think quite a few of those folks are also doing the the South Beach so having some of that social facilitation may help as well is that something you think we might be interested in,1
Miss Jones you had said that uh maybe your confidence level wasn't too great because of some of the failures and kind of stop starts that you'd had in the past so if I can use another one of those scales on a confidence 0 being no confidence at all that you can do this or 10 being very confidence you can do this where do you think you are in terms of,1
tell me more about why a 7 or an 8 and not 4 or 5,1
good so it sounds like we have a plan if it's ok I'll again give you this information sheet that has the website information and costs and that sort of thing we'll give you the information on the weight management support group and there's even some information on exercise there if that's something that you're interested in at some point and and if it's ok we'll see you back in 2 or 3 weeks is there a day miss change that would be best for you to start this diet,1
so Monday very good it sounds like we have a plan,1
thank you for your time and we'll see you in several weeks,1
well let me introduce myself properly my name's Colin I'm one of the registered nurses working here at the center I particularly work with clients who are thinking about changing their behavior in some way but I should address you by what name would you prefer mr. Jones,1
well you know that is a good way of thinking about I'm certainly not going to be coming to the gym with you or anything like that but sure thinking about that as a coach would would help,1
so I wondered it to get started if as a few things that we just lay out before we get going,1
so my understanding is that you're here to talk about your substance use and I do want to point out that anything that you say to us will be kept confidential and in the sense that we don't discuss your business needlessly I do share information with other members of the healthcare team and if they tell me anything that that it sounds as though you rather put yourself at risk imminent risk or putting someone else at imminent risk of harm or indeed that a child might be at risk then I do have a statutory responsibility to do something about that,1
is there anything I've said so far that you want to ask about,1
well there are some specific questions that we ask of everyone when we're doing this first kind of a meeting Nathan but before getting to that I'd like to put that aside and begin just by hearing from you brings you here,1
sure it's quite understandable to be nervous coming in to talk to it like this,1
so quite a few things going on for you there then the idea that you've been getting Eretz of all we've been hurting people that you love even and and you mentioned also missing some job opportunities or some work opportunities,1
could you tell me more is you've been partying your wife's been getting upset with you,1
so you think that perhaps you've been drinking too much,1
you've given me a lot of information so far but some of the things that have brought you here ma'am you've talked about not have been missing job opportunities you've talked about getting irritable and Anastas and um it being different and even hurting people that you love you've also mentioned that you've been drinking a bit more partying a bit more and also using some cocaine and I'm wondering what would it be helpful for you to focus on today if and what would be good for you to talk about now,1
but thinking a bit worse but what has been the worst thing that's ever happened to you since you've been or when you were using cold five things,1
so it's not remembering and that I must be scary too it's a to not remember things,1
so quite a few things going on then it's you know you've suggested that it's from Europe for you copious that you're not remembering things that you know you're putting yourself at risk and it's scary for you,1
your family your wife your friends are all really important to you,1
thinking about importance Nathan how important would it be for you to to make changes to your copious,1
it's good to use imaginary skills absolutely so so for you ten would be the the most important and do you know,1
I mean so it's very important to you then I wonder why is an eight and not let's see a four,1
it's like there really are a lot of good reasons for you two to think about changing,1
so and certainly labels aren't alcoholic labels aren't important what do what do you know about cocaine and alcohol and how they work,1
I guess one of the issues that I really wanted to highlight is that when alcohol and cocaine get used together which is reasonably common but for among cocaine users and what actually happens is that when alcohol and cocaine mixed together they form a third substance and actually has some surprising effects it can stay in your system a whole lot longer and can also give you a feeling where you don't feel as drunk as you would normally do and sometimes that means you can drink to excess and not even realize you've done it,1
so for you if you were to stop one it would be the cocaine,1
so thinking about stopping how confident are you that you actually could stop if you wanted to you told me earlier was very important to you but I won't know confident you are and maybe again in an imaginary scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the most confident one is the least confident,1
four so there's somewhat competent then I wonder why it's four unless you know a one,1
so a lot of you your friends use and it could be quite tempt and and you're sure you could stop,1
so there are some things you could do to help yourself stop them,1
and these are great ideas Nathan you've told me quite a lot this morning so far and I honestly want to hear more about your your own ideas about what would help you to start I'm I did mention earlier that I had some specific questions to ask you and I wonder if now might be a good time for us to maybe if I summarized everything that's been said so far and then maybe we could switch back to these specific questions but how would that feel for you that work,1
yeah okay let's let's do that then okay Nathan so you've told me quite a lot of horrible things that have been happening since you began using cocaine and particularly you become concerned about your recent users you've noticed that your moods been quite irritable that you're hurting people that you love that you've been missing opportunities for work you've not been sleeping very well you've also told me that you've been taking some pictures off at risks and and that scares you and also not even remembering sometimes for what you've done which I guess is also really scary you've told me it's very important for you to start using and you've also indicated that you have some confidence that you could stop in fact you've even come up with some strategies does that sound about right to you you,1
my name is Alex and I'm going to be the nurse taking care of you today so could you please tell me a little bit of about why you're here,1
so you were your mom suggested to come here because you were obese,1
okay can I ask you do you see yourself as overweight,1
okay well can I tell you a little bit about what being overweight means,1
okay so what it is is basically how we determine that is we're using the BMI so body mass index scale and at the end of it it gives us a number and a number of 25 and higher is associated with being overweight so based on your physical exam results earlier on you're at the 95th percentile,1
very top of the scale which for lack of a better word but she was overweight,1
there are health risks associated with it but I don't want to scare you I'm going to inform you but before we get there do you mind if I get to know you in your situation a little bit better,1
so what I like to do is get a little bit of history so throughout this do you mind if I ask you a questions regarding your diet and exercise habits,1
okay so so to start us off could you tell me a little bit about what you eat throughout the day so how's your habit like,1
okay all right so can you tell me a little bit more about what you like about that kind of food,1
so let me try to understand so you enjoy it because it's convenient it's on the go and it's always readily available when you need it your friends engage in it and your mom doesn't think it's not exactly of a cookers as much as I understand,1
okay so could you tell me a little bit about what are some things that you don't really like about it,1
so let me try to further understand so given the positives you just told me but you also feel like you're in pain for what I'm understanding your back on your knees and it's greasy and maybe you think that it's contributing to your body image and potentially affecting your relationships,1
so given that what you just told me do you think that the food is contributing to your weight gain,1
ok so not that I think we covered food and I understand a little bit better can I ask you about your exercise habits some things like any physical activity you engage in or anything like that,1
okay so if I understand you correctly it is about your priority right now,1
okay so I'm glad to hear that so can I ask you are you considering about making any changes to what you died at this point,1
so I five believes so if I understand it correctly you're considering to make that change because you don't want to develop a chronic illness later on the life in essentially avoiding conflict with your mother is that correct,1
okay so can I ask you on a scale of zero to ten now that you're considering about making a change zero being not important whatsoever and ten being super uber important how important is it for you to make this change,1
okay all right and let me ask you another question using a scale again so from scale of zero to ten zero being I'm not confident whatsoever and 10 being I'm super confident how confident are you that you will be able to make this change,1
okay so you are on the higher end of the scale in terms of how important it is to you to make that change however you are in the lower end of the scale in terms of your confidence what choose 4,1
well I'm thank you for telling me that I'm glad to hear that I was able to provide you with some information so that you can take control of your situation so thank you so much but can I ask you something else in order to change or in this case increase that confidence from before to maybe something higher is there anything that can help you with that,1
I want to say congratulations first of all for coming to see me I know with your mom nagging and that must it must be frustrating for you but it is you took that initiative you no matter through your mom's nagging you still came to see me so congratulations on that,1
and I really want to say also congratulations to taking this first step and seeing that this is something that could benefit you so that you don't want because from what I understand you don't want to develop any chronic illness or any sort of health risk,1
so thank you so thank you for being here and congratulations again for taking that first step so right now would you like to discuss the potential health risks associated with weight gain and overeating junk food,1
I'm tired of the nagging I got I know the time to be,1
we can do to help you with this change well like was thinking about it maybe like I don't want nothing to do with exercise,1
but maybe you we can do some sort of like I don't know meal planner I don't know like something to do with like my diet maybe reduce what I'm eating,1
you know modify some of the things I'm eating I guess like I know pop is bad for me and that those chips so maybe I couldn't like reduce some of that maybe and change it from three to three to one pop a day,1
I mean I guess it's like I can see where you're coming like where it could benefit,1
um so yeah I mean it's worth a shot I mean how how bad can it be right I mean I have nothing to lose so,1
yeah why not I'll try it so over the next couple of weeks so if we were to set up a follow-up appointment would you be comfortable of keeping that journal and then coming to me after so we can review it together,1
thank you so can we let's recap what we talked about today so you came here to see me despite your mom nagging and making you feel like you have to be here because she said so but you were able to see that you were able to identify that this is something this is your decision this is something that would benefit you instead of your mom so you given me the goods and the bads of your junk food and you were able to essentially come up with some kind of an action plan so where its building that awareness of junk food and by being open to the idea of keeping a log is there anything I missed,1
yeah so can we make a follow up appointment where we can review that journal after to see what's working for you what's not working for you yeah sure,1
there's great seeing you thank you for coming to diabetes clinic today my name is Mark Smith I'm a pharmacist I work with dr. Pham and I we run the diabetes clinic and we basically serve to educate our patients so that I can better manage their their diabetes and looking at your chart I see that you are pre-diabetic so what we're going to do now is kind of focus on nutrition mostly diet and exercise okay ,1
I'm glad you had the opportunity to talk with the nutritionist I'm she's a very nice lady and she has some very valuable information do you mind telling me some of the things that she discuss with you,1
okay well I will show you what I normally go through with my patients and then you can let me know if there's any information that you covered with the nutritionist or any of the material it's new to you then that would be great as well basically we feel that going over the nutrition aspect of diabetes and pre-diabetes is so important there's so much that we can do without taking medications and we've seen many patients that have benefited from making just minor changes to their diet that are greatly impacted their health in a very positive way so to start off I'm just going to ask you a few questions about what you eat to get a better picture of your diet so first what did you have for breakfast ,1
okay spaghetti salad and bread okay so tell me then what about any snacking that you do throughout the day like any snacks or anything like that ,1
okay and also what kind of beverages and things that you drink what are some of the things that you drink throughout,1
okay okay well thanks for sharing a bit of information within this patient this kind of gives us a better idea of what you throughout the day so now I'm going to give you some information or show you some information about nutrition okay,1
okay all right so that's that's that's my ministrations but just just kind of bear with me so when I gather from your best far as that you know already you're fully aware of the things that you need to do in order to live a healthy lifestyle and take care of yourself however you seem to find it difficult and you don't think that it works for you is that that's kind of the fish that I'm getting so explain to me what are some of the barriers that you feel exists that prevents you from eating healthier and losing weight ,1
okay then I understand completely that finances can be a potential issue and an issue especially when it comes to eating healthy more importantly picking out the right healthy foods for your kids to end and also to have good taste is also a priority to you so tell me about you know we're going to switch and transition from diet and talk about exercise tell me about your normal exercise routine ,1
what are some of the barriers you believe that prevent you from exercising on a regular basis ,1
all right and then what what ultimate benefits let's talk about benefits what benefits that you feel that you can ultimately gain by by seeking out more nutritious foods and incorporating exercise into a daily regimen regimen and an overall losing weight what do you think would be the benefits of doing all that,1
okay maybe okay maybe yes yes ma'am well and and then those things are exactly correct on what I would like to do miss Fisher I know that you're pressed for time I'm not going to take too much of your time but I would like to schedule min and I and basically sit down with you and kind of go over some some helpful alternatives and basically look at some cost effective type thing since cost is an issue with you and then also look at some resources that we can channel into when it comes to exercise you'll soon find out that some of the exercises that you can do they don't even require a gym membership so you know if that's something deal at because you mentioned to me that time and money are contouring for you so we basically want to work with you together to see if we can get something that that better suits you you know and get you on the right track when it comes to your pre-diabetes and overall losing weight so would you like to come in and scheduling Pullman with us about a week from now ,1
yes ma'am yes ma'am I believe that so what what we do is we'll schedule a week from now and but it was it was a pleasure talking with you and I very much look forward to working with you okay all right yeah we good rest of the day okay all right  ,1
good morning Jenny thank you for coming in again how have you been doing since the last time we met ,1
yeah so you you saw your without your boyfriend beating up another girl ,1
okay so how do you feel about that how how do you feel about he'll be up and in front of you ,1
so it sounds like it affected you to witness stuff ,1
wow so you afraid that he might do that to you and you you kind of view him viewed him in the past or until last night as a protector so you afraid that he might do that to you also,1
so he's getting out of control he's getting out of control,1
so you are afraid for your life you're afraid that he might do it to you sooner than later ,1
ok so I'm so what I'm hearing is that you you are starting to be afraid of your man yeah and you are tired of witnessing all this abuse happening and you would like to to try something else maybe work out a store but you're not sure if the money will be enough because you're not used to making you know just minimum wage and you are you're not sure you're not sure if you want to leave that life but you are afraid you're afraid for yourself ,1
it's important to you that you make a certain amount of money to support yourself ,1
so it's so on one hand it's it's important to you that you have nice things that you make a certain amount of money but then the other you don't want to continue risking your life this ways that that's what I'm hearing that you don't want to continue with this lifestyle you feel like it's getting out of hand as far as the violence ,1
ok so it's it's it seems like you you would like to do something different but it is a particular type of job you would like to do and the type of money you would like to make ,1
so you feel like you're not you're not smart enough good enough to try something different ,1
yeah so you would like to try something different you would like to maybe try a different type of work but you're afraid that people will not give you a chance and they will judge you based on on the fact that you dropped out of high school and you've been working the streets and so you're afraid that maybe people will not see that you you are smart and and you want things in life and coming in here and speaking about it is a good thing you know and no and understanding that maybe I can try something different is a good thing you know it's it's it takes courage and and you afraid that people will not see that in you ,1
so you would you would rather a safe place that you don't mind what you're doing but you you you you would like for it to be a little safer for you and ,1
these things like you you know you you want you you don't mind the job in one way but you afraid for your life and you also want to try something different like you want to do to show the world that you can you know you can do other things and you you know even though you dropped out of high school you can have another job but at the same time having a certain type of the money making a certain type of money is important to you and having nice things on point ,1
okay so you can't you can't do anything as far as for yourself like you can't apply for school i'm leaving there,1
so you would write you would you would like to apply for college but you afraid that you might get killed if your man finds out that you are applying for college so it seems like it means something to you that you you continue your education ,1
so one day you would like to move out but you don't think it can work out right now as far as your living situation ,1
okay okay so what I'm hearing is that you know you would like to try something different you would wrap you would like to go to college but you are afraid to even apply for to go to college because you don't want your man to find out you know you you feel like you can do something better with your life but the opportunities or not you don't feel like the opportunities are there for you right now but but glad that you are you know you come here and you talk about it it's encouraging and it'd take a lot of you know stress to do that and I thank you for coming today and and we will resume next week and and thank you for coming it takes a lot of courage thank you thank you  ,1
I understand you're you're having some difficulties health symptoms can you tell me about those,1
how long have you been having these panic like sometimes,1
well I don't like them it's very weird when it happens but I think it's what I've got to deal with you know,1
it's good to see you today I understand you've been having some some troubling symptoms bother you feel comfortable tell me about this,1
last August like probably nine months it's about nine months,1
yeah yeah how about trembling like my hands shake it,1
you ever feel like you're choking when this is happening,1
I think you know you mentioned the chest pain how about nausea,1
in that case you actually it's actually causing you to avoid some things that used to do,1
it's almost like I can see myself having it like,1
yeah yeah like that's why you know I was packing up my gym bag and then I thought about how it happened and you know like was thinking about doing the you know the spinning class that brought it on so I didn't even pack up my gym bag that I was sitting there and I had like my shorts and got even just thinking about it it was you know yeah I started freaking out right there my bedroom with my bag open,1
yeah you know what it's really embarrassing but I don't even drive on Market Street because you know my husband was driving down Market Street and one started and you know it's really embarrassing yeah there's some things that I'm not doing it all but it's it's getting in the way,1
this information has been really helpful I appreciate,1
I did to do the bus to work sometimes know if I if I take the bus I mean what if that happens on the bus more am I gonna go,1
I can feel the heartbeat actually yeah I haven't yeah that's become from,1
out but when I was at the mall with my husband and we were in line I could definitely feel it you know actually you know what we put our stuff down and I didn't even buy it we left,1
yeah we've been doing a lot of it but yeah hope being outside alone in general that's been taking,1
that sometimes helps if you have something else with you,1
okay when you find yourself out in crowds and close spaces and open places what response you're having like what's what's happening when you're out there sight let's just use for example a crowd at the mall,1
even seeing it with me it's a scary thing for his fearful,1
it's getting away of your life yeah and you're potentially in treatment I'm glad you did he did come do you think that the response you're having does seem to match a danger level around you like you feel like the most dangerous or the spaces of danger so you think about logically,1
you mentioned this we call for nine months yeah it does seem like it's getting in the way of your life do you have any severe or moderate medical conditions how are you physically,1
well let me introduce myself properly my name's Colin I'm one of the registered nurses working here at the center I particularly work with clients who are thinking about changing their behavior in some way but I should address you by what name would you prefer mr. Jones,1
well you know that is a good way of thinking about I'm certainly not going to be coming to the gym with you or anything like that but sure thinking about that as a coach would would help,1

is there anything I've said so far that you want to ask about,1
well there are some specific questions that we ask of everyone when we're doing this first kind of a meeting Nathan but before getting to that I'd like to put that aside and begin just by hearing from you brings you here,1
sure it's quite understandable to be nervous coming in to talk to it like this,1
so quite a few things going on for you there then the idea that you've been getting Eretz of all we've been hurting people that you love even and and you mentioned also missing some job opportunities or some work opportunities,1
could you tell me more is you've been partying your wife's been getting upset with you,1
so you think that perhaps you've been drinking too much,1
you've given me a lot of information so far but some of the things that have brought you here ma'am you've talked about not have been missing job opportunities you've talked about getting irritable and Anastas and um it being different and even hurting people that you love you've also mentioned that you've been drinking a bit more partying a bit more and also using some cocaine and I'm wondering what would it be helpful for you to focus on today if and what would be good for you to talk about now,1
but thinking a bit worse but what has been the worst thing that's ever happened to you since you've been or when you were using cold five things,1
so it's not remembering and that I must be scary too it's a to not remember things,1
so quite a few things going on then it's you know you've suggested that it's from Europe for you copious that you're not remembering things that you know you're putting yourself at risk and it's scary for you,1
your family your wife your friends are all really important to you,1
thinking about importance Nathan how important would it be for you to to make changes to your copious,1
it's good to use imaginary skills absolutely so so for you ten would be the the most important and do you know,1
I mean so it's very important to you then I wonder why is an eight and not let's see a four,1
it's like there really are a lot of good reasons for you two to think about changing,1
so and certainly labels aren't alcoholic labels aren't important what do what do you know about cocaine and alcohol and how they work,1
I guess one of the issues that I really wanted to highlight is that when alcohol and cocaine get used together which is reasonably common but for among cocaine users and what actually happens is that when alcohol and cocaine mixed together they form a third substance and actually has some surprising effects it can stay in your system a whole lot longer and can also give you a feeling where you don't feel as drunk as you would normally do and sometimes that means you can drink to excess and not even realize you've done it,1
so for you if you were to stop one it would be the cocaine,1
so thinking about stopping how confident are you that you actually could stop if you wanted to you told me earlier was very important to you but I won't know confident you are and maybe again in an imaginary scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is the most confident one is the least confident,1
four so there's somewhat competent then I wonder why it's four unless you know a one,1
so a lot of you your friends use and it could be quite tempt and and you're sure you could stop,1
so there are some things you could do to help yourself stop them,1
and these are great ideas Nathan you've told me quite a lot this morning so far and I honestly want to hear more about your your own ideas about what would help you to start I'm I did mention earlier that I had some specific questions to ask you and I wonder if now might be a good time for us to maybe if I summarized everything that's been said so far and then maybe we could switch back to these specific questions but how would that feel for you that work,1
yeah okay let's let's do that then okay Nathan so you've told me quite a lot of horrible things that have been happening since you began using cocaine and particularly you become concerned about your recent users you've noticed that your moods been quite irritable that you're hurting people that you love that you've been missing opportunities for work you've not been sleeping very well you've also told me that you've been taking some pictures off at risks and and that scares you and also not even remembering sometimes for what you've done which I guess is also really scary you've told me it's very important for you to start using and you've also indicated that you have some confidence that you could stop in fact you've even come up with some strategies does that sound about right to you you,1
so brings you here today well my doctor made me come said of my diet is bad and my cholesterol level is up so high that I've got to change the way I eat and honestly I don't really feel like doing that so he said I had to come talk to you and hopes that that's going to help,1
right it was actually I feel pretty good they do a test on me and says mom not healthy because what I eat them I don't know it doesn't bother me,1
I like french fries I like fast food I don't want of time to cook you know this is the food I eat his burgers it's what's my lifestyle and he says I got to stop eating french fries sometimes pizza I like sausage and a breakfast I eat almost the whole pound of bacon log bacon bacon on my eggs bacon on the sandwiches I like bacon on the cheeseburgers the doctors like mr. Hendricks you have to stop eating bacon wait a minute I don't know about that french fries,1
okay so what do you thing to do to help resolve the issue,1
okay will sound like you have it this semester issue the food thing you are not great to give up but exercising to be a possible Avenue just to lower your cholesterol levels ok so how motivated are you today start like a rigorous exercise 18 the lord I kept glycerol,1
okay so what could you do this week to start now once you've in this office today to have lower your cholesterol,1
okay have you know participant I can exercise over the floor,1
ya knows me a lot of work and I respect your decision that you are not ready to give the food but you have a decision to make good choices it is your choice to do with you is it D but this is too much for you like you're incapable of this this is beyond you you can now show your dad,1
so how would you know if you're not happy until you try it,1
is that the highest like today that you've been or wish your motivation I'm lowering operators after my last doctor appointment,1
okay so this is like neglect for the three or four years,1
so before we begin let's update your medical history it's important we're doing this at each time because your oral health can affect your general health and vice versa are you taking any new medication as a moment no if you had any major surgery or serious illness in the past six months no have no changes,1
yes I've been been in for a while but lately I've noticed these white spots appearing on my teeth they've sure that they're before,1
yeah that's right um usually have it around lunchtime and I just slowly sip it throughout the afternoon that way I don't feel like having another can later I just have the one can,1
yeah see online all the time about how sugars really bad for your teeth so I try not to eat like lollies and other stuff like that too much,1
no I didn't know that what if I just switched to diet soft drink instead there's no sugar in that right,1
okay well just like I got the chance can I ask you about this thing I've read online so it's where people swish coconut oil in their mouth and they use that to just stop the hulls from forming and they do that for about ten minutes should I give that a shot,1
yeah well usually have it around lunchtime so I could just have it all in one shot then,1
well I really don't want these spots turning into holes so I say about eight or nine,1
no problem I have this in stock but I do notice that these prescriptions from the hospital can you tell me more about that,1
I did have some auto refills for you in the pharmacy unfortunately to return to stock since you weren't able to pick them up but if you give me twenty minutes I can get them all ready for you,1
that's terrible John asbestos in your first day coming back from the hospital but I did want to talk to you about one thing the ibuprofen is you're holding especially with your medical condition will have a tendency to reduce blood flow to your kidneys,1
well if you don't mind John if we can go over to the side area and I can discuss with you further kind of see your ankle John,1
does look swollen does it hurt anymore mark when you move it does,1
I think the best thing for now is to get a cold pack and elevate your ankle to 45 degrees let me grab that for you real quick so this is the instant cold pack so just basically to activate it you just squeeze in place it around your ankle and elevate it to 45 degrees and the reason why I feel more comfortable with this recommendation is because you've told me about your kidney problem in the hospital I really don't feel comfortable with you're using ibuprofen and because if your liver condition the fluid is pooling in your abdomen which is restricting the blood flow to the kidney ibuprofen will further restrict blood flow to the kidney and your blood pressure medication the lisinopril there's normally a very good medication that will further reduce blood flow to the kidney and the total effect of all three of these factors will drastically reduce buffer to the kidney and the kidney failure and that's why I feel more comfortable with the cold pack recommendation and if you have further questions we can talk to your doctor,1
that's why we're here and if you want to walk with me back to the pharmacy I can get all your prescriptions rung up for you you,1
so you're really not confident that you'd be successful long-term,1
you know like I know quitting is really hard and it takes a lot of strength to go through that but is it the hardest thing you've ever done,1
well in all seriousness is I know there's other hard things you've been through so if quitting really the toughest thing you've ever done,1
it is a different type of difficulty you're right and I don't want to make light of that but what I'm the point I'm trying to make with you is that it was difficult and you rose to the challenge and you got through it,1
so what I know of you is that when you're faced with a tough challenge like a divorce you rise to the occasion and you manage to get through it and you come out on top so are you ready for the challenge of quitting,1
well I do totally respect your decision if you really don't want to quit and you're not open to it then you know that is your choice whatever you choose to do about your smoking habit really is your choice and I do respect that so where do we go from here,1
cutting down that would be a great step I mean that would be wonderful so I know you've tried before what else have you learned what other lessons have you learned from quitting I'm guessing you've learned a lot of lessons,1
well I have some ideas on that if you'd be open to hearing them,1
they've got a lot of new flavors on the gum they're cinnamon and orange and juicy fruit which is a popular one and mint and I've had a lot of people have favorable things to say about the new flavors,1
how about if I cut back for a month and then I'll try the gum,1
hi Nate thank you for completing the craft questionnaire I also appreciate you sharing some information about yourself,1
I see from the questionnaire did you have gotten in trouble while using alcohol can you tell me more about that,1
let me make sure I understand you have tried drinking a couple times and you almost got in trouble once did I get that right,1
as your provider I'm a little concerned about your health drinking alcohol could harm you and I would like to share some information with you is that okay,1
I understand you're just experimenting with alcohol then how about if you share with me what the effects of alcohol are,1
well you might not be drinking that much and other kids are also trying alcohol I like to share with you the risk of using alcohol and drugs could really harm you because your brain still changing it also you're very a hydrous for becoming addicted alcohol and drugs could also interfere with your role in life and your goals especially in sports and it could cause on attendants sex how do you feel about this information,1
based on your reason for your visit today I feel like you really want to play soccer and you have great goals about that,1
this scholarship will really help you achieving your goals,1
I would like to share with you this materials to show the risk of drinking at younger age I also wanted to encourage you to think about this risk what do you think about that,1
it sounds like you're in the right track looks like you care about your health and you care about your goals in life I'm here to answer any questions,1
hi this is dr. Grande I hope you find this video useful if that's the case please like it and subscribe to my channel as always thanks for watching,1
I'm good thanks for asking I understand you've come here today to the agency because you have a recent arrest,1
okay so what's been going on what is gonna happen,1
so you feel like you can get out of the rehab part too-,1
all right so with this recent arrest you realize it may be about you to stop using but really don't want to,1
when you drink do you ever socialize at the same time,1
so doesn't sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using,1
alright it's been a bit of a situation all right so you have the use takes away pain for you it takes away anxiety feels good but then you have these consequences of the law,1
all right so you can't imagine that so was it at the other side can you imagine having further incensed with law enforcement more charges in the future,1
so you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not I really have a consequence and you'll be more careful in the future,1
so with that thinking you could continue to use as you were that you would take out the part that got you in trouble,1
the first you have to get out of trouble this time,1
so if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it,1
so you know if you had no anxiety no pain you'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends how would they respond if you went out with them and didn't drink,1
so the quitting and alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good route for you,1
but then you have this this recent situation which is making you second-guess some of it,1
so you could reduce your usage avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety in the pain,1
that's something you've been tossing around though this idea of isolating a little bit more and drinking a little less seems like all your options here kind of grim,1
is that just is that just me or does it seem that way to you to,1
you don't have any choice what's gonna happen it's going to happen,1
all right so let's start with early know or pick up with what we know you don't want to make a bad impression in this whole court proceeding with the DUI what do you think you could do that would make a bad person,1
that wouldn't look good either all right so you want to avoid those behaviors for sure so you know for sure you don't want it those things would it be acceptable to do those things,1
all right so would you appreciate those as goals like avoiding those situations like going in the court drunk,1
you're not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea,1
this whole DUI thing  it's really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed,1
so is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life event that does change things,1
what if as a condition of your treatment the judge says no more drinking in no more marijuana period legacy to that you obey those rules or or jail,1
let's go back a couple of steps how long have you been using the alcohol marijuana,1
have you ever until now with the DUI have you ever envisioned stopping,1
what's your plan like what pre DUI well is your plan in all this,1
yeah so without this or something you would have continued using yeah for years to come,1
could this be in a strange way like an opportunity,1
you could give it a shot you're just not sure you could you could actually do it,1
so where do you want to go from here you have this DUI I imagine a hearing or some type coming up right here to see me what can I do to help you,1
like a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality,1
all right so between now I'm going to see again do you have any hearings or anything coming up,1
a few more weeks so I'll see you again I know you have the IOP and everything here I'll see you again in a week and let's pick up with that anything changes we're hearing is moved up just snubby now,1
so I don't know how much you know already about sort of my role here and why you're even here so I thought I'd start by telling you a little bit about myself basically my job is to meet with all of the students I meet with everybody about once or twice a semester and just talk with you a little bit about how things are going different behaviors that you might be engaging in and thinking about any changes you might want to make for your life if you decide that you do it's not my job to change you I couldn't even if I wanted to that's not my role at all it's really to help you think about you know how things are going for you and how you might like making changes or moving forward that sound okay all right so why don't we start by you telling me a little bit about yourself,1
very cool I've always wanted to be good at music all right so it sounds like you're in band and a few other musical ensembles any other hobbies you have or things you like to do for fun,1
it's kind of everyday sort of thing okay tell me a little bit about your family,1
very fun all right and how are things going in school for you,1
okay great so you're doing well what sorts of goals do you have for after college or after high school,1
it's great that's really exciting to think about that and he's going to be looking forward to the future and those things all right well one thing I'm going to ask you about is um you know different people have sort of different things that they really value in their life whether it's you know their cultural identity or their family or their friends or job or hobbies things like that so here's a little sheet that goes through just some basic values that might be more or less important to certain people like belonging or sense of community again cultural identity or family friendship modesty religion respect self-determination and spirituality so when you think about yourself which of these are kind of most important to you in terms of your life,1
okay can you tell me a little bit about why you picked those three,1
okay great so sort of being a part of a group and being a part of a team gives you a sense of belonging like you said a sense of purpose anyway and then the respect is really sort of all-encompassing it's not just Authority but respecting yourself respecting your teammates or your bandmates and other people around you okay that's great all right well one of the things I want to talk to you about sort of relates to belonging and your friends so what kinds of things do you like to do when you get together with your friends,1
mm-hmm and when you're hanging out with friends is there ever alcohol involved,1
okay can you tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits into sort of your social scene,1
mm-hmm and so when you go to parties most of the time there's alcohol there okay and how often do you think you would say you're drinking,1
mm-hmm so about half the time you're drinking and half the time you're not can you tell me what's different about the days when you choose to drink versus not to drink,1
so it really depends on what the activity is whether or not alcohols get,1
okay and do you notice a big difference or can you tell me about the difference in your enjoyment level at say a party versus and that you're playing board games,1
okay what are the things that you like about drinking or like about alcohol,1
okay so sort of in the the too much drinking or our times can you tell me some of the less good things or not so good things about alcohol,1
hmm so you're trying to like you said not engage in really dangerous activities you're trying to stay put you're not driving you're trying to stay with people that you trust but yet it sounds like there's still some some things happening,1
yeah throwing up is never fun it's not and how often do you think that happened,1
huh okay so on the one side some of the fun things associated with alcohol are people are just more relaxed sort of carefree and kind of let loose a little bit more on the other hand there's a little bit more I guess planning involved because you have to make sure that you're doing it safely or as safe as you can and then there can be some other consequences like throwing up or even if it's not you that sometimes you're stuck your your fun is sort of ruined when you're stuck dealing with a friend you drink too much okay any other not-so-good things about the alcohol,1
so you're kind of stuck being exposed to things you don't mean busy,1
got it okay all right well you mentioned a couple times that you've made a few decisions to try and limit the a dangerous aspect of the drinking why did you make those decisions,1
okay yeah it sounds kind of similar to your your value of respect too so on the one hand you the drinking maybe helps with the belonging community to start if there's too much then,1
right and then with the respect one of the things you mentioned is really wanting to respect yourself and not sort of cross boundaries not sort of cross lines how do you think that the drinking fits in with that,1
okay so you're sort of looking for that balance yeah how much you can drink to have some of the positive benefit but about crossover okay and what have you come up with it at this point do you have sort of a limit that you stick to or,1
mm-hmm and do you feel like that's working pretty well for you or you sometimes exceed that limit or or what do you think,1
so a portion of the time it's working well for you and another portion of the time maybe you like,1
like to make some adjustments to to make it a little smoother okay so kind of thinking along those lines how important is it to you to make some changes or make some adjustments to your drinking to sort of fit with your values and your goals for yourself,1
like I you know it is nice to let loose and have fun but I'd also like it to be so you know I'm not damaging my body and I like my liver doesn't work by the time I'm like 22,1
uh-huh so kind of combined he has goals okay so you're you have a goal it sounds like of actually cutting back on your drinking how important is it to you to work on that goal on on the scale of one to ten where one is not at all important antennas it's the most important thing right now,1
uh-huh well why did you say six or seven rather than like a four,1
yeah looking ahead you can't keep drinking this way and reach the goals that you have for years now okay well how confident are you that you could cut down if you wanted to,1
okay and so you mentioned you know quite a few reasons why you would like to cut down have you thought at all about how you might go about doing that,1
so sort of trying to plan more activities that don't involve alcohol and then also trying to participate in activities without drinking yourself or maybe even drinking less than you're drinking okay does that sound like a goal you want to work on now or,1
okay um so I guess we'll talk about less alcohol activities and just making some notes to myself and then maybe I'm reducing the amount of drinking that you're doing if alcohol is involved okay so that's that goal sounds feasible you said would it be okay if we met in a couple weeks to sort of see how it's going,1
does that sound like something you'd like to do okay well I really appreciate you spending the time talking to me and you know it sounds like you have a lot of really good goals for yourself really ambitious goals and going to medical school and you know becoming a psychiatrist or some some other form of physician you're really looking forward to doing well in school so you can get there and it sounds like you have a pretty active social life and a lot of friends who you feel probably would be supportive even if you cut down on alcohol and that you know there's a lot of benefits you see both to your body and your health you school performance and even some of the social stuff in terms of feeling a sense of belonging without having to deal with some of the gross consequences of drinking too much so yeah you know it really sounds to me like you have a good plan in place and as long as you're willing and interested in meeting again and be very excited to be able to talk with you about how it's going,1
alright great so I'll plan to see you then in a few more weeks,1
so Chris they wanted to talk to you you know you're one of our starter athletes of really value you as a team player as athletic director one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and I understand you were there and so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now,1
so here you are you're an honor student you're star athlete you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years and maybe last month sometime you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first but now you're already noticing some consequence,1
it's really changed your focus yeah what do you like about drinking,1
so helps you kind of used to not feel more relaxed,1
sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though mom got mad at you you're having decreased focus you're kind of not doing so well in school maybe,1
so your your friends that you were hanging out with there's a little tension there now,1
well given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships it's affecting your studying it's affecting your relationship with your mom where do you think you should to kind of go from here,1
how important is it to you to make an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit,1
how confident are you that you could actually change or you're drinking or even cut down or quit,1
on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all antennas completely when,1
all right what do you think's a realistic goal for you then,1
your goal is kind of to not drink at all or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very most,1
yeah Chris they really appreciate you talking with me about this I know it seems like something it's been on your mind as it is and you know like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you so I'm glad we were able to talk about this it really seems like you have a good plan going forward you know really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there's alcohol making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum sounds like something that'll work for you,1
yeah that's my pleasure as part of my job as part I like best so I'm gonna hurry up and get changed for practice,1
Would you like to answer some questions and kind of do a self evaluation about how you're feeling around alcohol on the contraception,1
okay so we're working on a 10-point scale of one to ten one being not important can be very important one being not confident one being very confident so on a scale of one to ten which number best reflects how important it is to you to drink the low risk lips,1
you'd say I'm eight okay and on a scale of one to ten how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below risk levels,1
amount of four okay and so let's look at those two here you're thinking that's pretty important but your confidence is down here a four but it's not a one what makes you confident that you can drink the low risk levels and you remember what those are,1
okay so that gives you a good reason not to drink okay anything else,1
so you have a support group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink,1
now let's look at your self evaluation of your birth-control views so now we're doing the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control so on a scale of one to ten how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to keep from getting pregnant,1
an eight okay and on a scale of one to ten how confident are you at the present time to you that you can use effective birth control,1
probably a six okay so you're pretty confident that you can do it and why are us six and not a two or a three,1
okay so it's kind of linked to your drinking the fact that that you can if you can take care of that drinking you can take care of the birth control issue and this importance comes down as your reason why you're not down here,1
very good so it looks like you're using a good method of birth control you're just not able to use it effectively and you've linked it back search of the drinking so would you like to develop a plan around your alcohol use of this today,1
okay and if you need more information we can get that for you,1
so your workplace just went smoke free you're not too pleased huh,1
okay tell me a little bit about how smoking fits in your day it'll help with the,1
okay so you feel like right now smoking is a pretty important part of your life it's not something you're ready to change but if the time came when you did decide to quit you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that,1
mm-hmm and so in terms of a readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt where do you think you fall on the scale of one to ten where one is I'm not considering it at all and ten is I'm definitely ready I want to quit,1
well there are a lot of products available now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke we have products that can help to replace nicotine which can help to decrease withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medications that your doctor could prescribe for you that might take away even some of the desire to smoke,1
sure and back to that skill you mentioned you said you're a - what do you think it would take to move you up to a four or five,1
sure I wonder if now that your workplace is going smoke-free if there will be some people at work who are planning to quit,1
okay well it sounds like you're really here just for information today I'm happy to help you pick out some of these products if and when you decide that the time is right for you,1
hello kelsey thank you for coming in today I'm Shelley see our own personal trainers I shall be through you um so why are you here today there's some behaviors you want to change anything that you want to take care of,1
all right so um what are some pros and cons to eating candy,1
alright so what I hear you saying is that you really enjoy how can you taste and it makes you feel good at the moment I'm assuming because you're getting the pleasure oh you can't be um but afterwards you just you don't like the way that makes your body feel you feel bogged down and gross and then potentially see the side effects of maybe unwanted weight gain and things that you're striving to prevent,1
okay so on a scale of 0 to 10 how much do you think you can make the change to quit eating candy,1
okay well it's not a zero so you have some confidence in yours,1
all right um so when you say that you have candy at work is there any way you can get rid of that,1
sometimes just thank you know the cookies over or katie jo should i say all right so what are your goals how do you see yourself quitting in canyons,1
okay good good so what are you saying correct me if I'm wrong is you think that logging your sugar intake is going to help you see on top of the way you feel after you eat candy how much can you you're actually eating,1
good good i understand that it's really hard quitting kidding i myself have been known in the past you eat a ton of canyon or the city right right this or can you explain me again just some more reasons why you think it's going to be hard and why you think you can do it,1
and can you clarify for me one more time the kind of pleasure you get from eating candy,1
yeah so what you're saying is that candy brings back good memories and it tastes good and it makes you happy but at the same time it frustrates you and you're having a hard time letting it go because of work I mean it's hard to get rid of things when they're so prevalent in your life and candy is everywhere we look,1
so I would just like to understand a little bit more on how you're going to put definite goals I'd like to write down four goals for you on how we want to derail your need for handy,1
have you ever considered maybe talking to your boss I'll moving the candy jar from the table to maybe an instant table next to the door or something so it's out of reach,1
because really i mean its athletes we're working with you and athlete like yourself,1
should not be eating candy do i think that you can maybe make a push and get some gratification for yourself out of improving the lives of others one for being your own,1
ok so you're really willing to make this change apparently,1
ok um and you've already started you started with the post-it notes um my only other suggestion if you don't mind me giving you a suggestion,1
would be like you said with the fruit consider all of the food you're taking in because sometimes after you exercise your body crave sugar because you're not getting enough complex car such as like bread or rice or something like that before you workout so your blood Sugar's just dropping so just monitor the way you feel more than just the pleasure since you get from the delicious,1
all right well I'm excited for you so I'll will take a look at the log and we'll reevaluate these goals here in about two weeks and we'll see how the candy is going hopefully your boss will work with you some,1
so you came into therapy today because your girlfriend pressured you ,1
so you weighed the cost benefit and decided to come in ,1
and what she would like you to do and this is her goal not yours would be to stop smoking,1
can you tell me does some of the other good things possible ,1
so smoking the way you're presenting it there's been a positive thing in your life ,1
you don't seem like you're too worried about the the negative aspects ,1
so let me ask you a question I want you to give a response between - this is called scaling and is to do it the importance of stopping smoking so one would be it's not important to you and  would be it's extremely important where do you think you'd put that number,1
now let me ask you the same question except instead of importance how confident or how about confidence how confident are you that you could quit smoking on a scale once to have one being not confident all and ten being extremely confident ,1
sostopping smoking is not important to you but you're fairly confident you could if you decided you would so based on kind of where you are in terms of it doesn't seem like you're interested in stopping smoking what would be a goal how could we spend this time so that it would be productive ,1
so to help her to understand why the smoking works for you yeah that's that's one goal there any other goals you could think of I mean you came in in part because you're well soon here like you came in completely because your girlfriend pressured it yeah so any other relational goals so my work on there,1
productive communication and productive arguments right yeah yeah so so one goal would be to illustrate clearly the advantages of smoking to your girlfriend where actually understands how important it is to you yeah because it does seem like it's really important but another would be to work on your relation your relational style so that you you can end argument feel like you're not in a stalemate right ,1
well you want to make those the goals that we work one so that we can spend this time yeah I can do it that it's kind of like killing two birds with one stone don't make sense to you hmm well that's what we'll do so wait like you do I'll see you again and about a week right right so if you could reflect on some of these changes do you think you can make with this relationship well you could do in the relationship to be a more effective communicator because a lot of this revolves around communication oh yeah communicating the advantages of smoking but also communicating in the arguing so that you have to end to these arguments right it's really more moving from arguments to collegial conversations that have a positive result yeah yeah that would be cool we can do that okay so if you could work on kind of thinking that through and then the next time we meet we'll talk about those different goals and maybe ways to make some small changes you know in that relationship to to meet those goals right all right suck it all right thanks for coming in con man thank you  ,1
good well I am too and it's a pleasure to be here thank you for trusting me I've got the questionnaire that you filled out earlier for us and I brought that with me today,1
I made a few notes for myself and I want to go through and ask you some additional questions but before I get the questionnaire out for us to begin talking let me tell you a little bit about today and that today is about you I'm gonna be asking you quite,1
so I'm gonna be asking you some in-depth questions and some of them you may have questions about why I'm asking the questions and you're perfectly okay to to ask me about that if that comes up for you I'm I can answer your questions as well but what I'm gonna be doing is asking you things about in detail about what kinds of things you eat and also other lifestyle things and that will help me put together a program for you moving ahead so thank you for the advance work that you did and thanks for your patience as I get the bag out here,1
well you know something you're um you are really already pretty far ahead in the in the continuum of things now that this is something that we should be judging it's not like there's a good way or a bad way and one of the things I say to my clients is this if we look at the way that we eat and we live our lifestyles as a continuum with one end of the spectrum being the standard American diet and people who we know are doing some unhealthy things and then at the other end of the spectrum you've got the really really really healthy people that you don't ever want to be around because they make you feel guilty for everything you do and every choice that you make yes we all do and if you can find a spot for you on that continuum that fits for you at any particular given period of time that's what it is that we're trying to do here and it's not a judging thing it's not that you're trying to get from one fit place together and and remember this also Michelle as we work together there will be points in time when you will feel like you're on top of the world and you're doing good job and something may happen for you that causes you to have a little bit of a setback maybe stress at work maybe something happens in your personal life whatever or maybe it's the holidays and you're celebrating and you might have what you would call quote a setback it's not the end of the world and we'll talk as we go along about how to address those types of issues how to deal with those how to head them off at the pass so this is an ongoing continuum kinds of thing and remember it's a lifestyle this isn't a diet and so,1
absolutely the first couple of questions that I asked had to do with what what it was you consumed and I asked whether or not you ate meat chicken fish and so forth you're not vegetarian according to this and so you do eat some of those things talk to me a little bit about the sources of the food that you get the meat product,1
ok and I'll I'm gonna hit the pause button for you and tell you you know that I am personally and vegan and I'm a raw foodist,1
when I ask you these questions again it's not from a judging perspective it's not because I'm gonna say to you well we're gonna cut meat out of your diet in a hurry that's not the case at all what I'm asking the reason I'm asking is so that when I build things for you and build a program for you I'm accommodating the things that you're comfortable with if there are things that I ask you for example if you say I do eat meat now I don't want to and then we'll talk about that so that's where that question is coming from so I'm delighted to hear that you're conscious about the sources of your meat products or get,1
that's wonderful and then obviously you're aware of hormones and antibodies and those kind or antibiotics and those,1
we can let's leave that out yeah and the same thing with dairy products you've got some dairy products on your repertoire talk about that,1
do you ever have any ill effects from the dairy that you can sue,1
and the rest of the family is okay with that too okay good so when I'm asking the questions I'm primarily asking about you but if it if it comes up that somebody in your family if I hit a hot button and you say oh I don't have sinus problems but my my offspring do or my feelings do or whatever then let's talk about that as well um you have you have a husband,1
I understand you've been having some difficulties because of the trauma I want to ask you some questions about that that's okay so can you tell me a little bit about the traumatic event,1
that's your daughter your daughters at this daycare when the fire but she but she's okay,1
Thanks so let me continue to ask some different questions that's okay I appreciate you being able to recall the events of the trauma that's very difficult to speak about that so let me ask you about some symptoms nice let me know if you've been having them or not,1
have you found that you're having any type of intrusive or distressing memories about this event,1
have you ever hang trouble with distressing dreams since this event is happening,1
okay and have there ever been any other situations that have reminded you of this traumatic event like cues from the from the environment or anything for surroundings,1
see I'm gonna ask you a few more questions I appreciate your help so far in this I know this is tough going through all these all these questions and kind of reliving some of this I want to ask you about a couple of items that may be occurring and just let me know if they resonate with you feel like this has been going on since the strong okay do you find yourself working to avoid distressing memories thoughts or feelings that you associate with this traumatic event,1
you actively tried to avoid thinking and feeling a certain life,1
okay how about do you find yourself trying to avoid things that might remind you of that traumatic event,1
no it's actually fairly common but I appreciate you sharing this with I know it's difficult say I'm going to continue on some some other questions appreciate your patience all these these questions and you've been forthcoming with your answers I want to ask you some questions about a possible mood disturbances because this event do you ever find yourself unable to remember having trouble would remember important aspects of the trauma how about negative beliefs or expectations about yourself or others maybe kind of changing your attitude and the way you're relating to the world or yourself if you find yourself having distorted thinking that we kind of blame kind of blame yourself even though you clearly weren't responsible for it,1
guilt definitely sadness joke says yeah any think some anger it myself you know anger you know the the day care I mean where they have to code you know I definitely get angry at them for letting that happen my daughter there sometimes but,1
actually you know I haven't played tennis at all this has happened I you know I used to play twice a week and I just sort of feel like I don't want to yeah tennis I haven't got a book group I've been tired you know yeah,1
no no I mean I've been like talking to my book friends on Facebook you know my texts ya know,1
that kinda rings Bell does it yeah what would positive emotions do you feel like you're not being able to experience this,1
all right I have some more questions for you these have to do with a little little bit different topic but just same you know similarly if any of these kind of resonate with you if you've gone through them just something that,1
and this is I can't as with these other items this is symptoms I'm talking about it happen after or became worse after the trauma okay that's occurred or became hoarse after the trauma after it happened so have you found that your have angry outburst or you're more irritable more likely to express physical or verbal aggression how about any reckless or self-destructive behavior has that been a problem have you found yourself more aware of your environment my potential dangers,1
yeah like this curling iron could start a fire you know even driving you know what,1
well no I I guess I didn't really think about it as much before I mean that sounds kind of bad but now I'm thinking about it all the time you know even like somebody coming down the street like could he'd be dangerous should we move you know the other side of the street I said about you know definitely of things that could start a fire in the house and yeah I'm just really paranoid it seems a lot about you know our safety,1
it's that part of this because yeah the other day like my husband came up just to you know give me a hug and I like jumped I shouted you know what no what else happened we were watching something on TV and I was like he started laughing at me but it wasn't funny funny - no no yeah I know what you mean you know,1
it's it's about two months about two months ago yeah and,1
it's it's pretty pervasive we were out to dinner with you know our best friends and it was their anniversary and it was so nice that they asked us to come with them but I just you know it wasn't that fun that was just really I just kept thinking about her and being there that fire and it really yeah I'm sorry yeah,1
I'm feeling it all the time and I'm feeling it really intensely,1
so we have been asking questions this traumatic event and I appreciate your help in this can you tell me a little bit about this event,1
where was the stake character relation to her unit thought,1
um well I saw it on TV oh um Tina I saw it on the news yeah,1
no but you know I was recording the show that I watch and it was on there and so I've just gone back and watched it you know again and again my wife I've heard it a couple other times on the news hey everybody yeah,1
I have a lot of thoughts about it a lot of memories about it I think I've just kind of got to work through them you know we had this really sad but I can't let it roll my life you said it,1
not really I Drive by the fire I have fire house on my way to work most mornings like I see it and I think about that day but you know Who am I gonna do try six months out of my way you know I don't think so yeah,1
no I don't really feel you know a lot of joy or happiness you know I thought about that when I was like 16 17 8 I don't really feel joy like other people I don't think we never have,1
oh my god I jumped all over Joe this morning I mean he yeah he I mean continually puts his talent like right on the floor by the hammocks that I don't know I'm the servant or something just really I had enough and I used some foul language as I showed him myself putting the talent in a hamper but you know and last night I had dinner you know ready and he didn't come home for like I don't know he's like an hour and a half late no call no texts nothing perfectly good steaks and potatoes went to waste and said I let him know that I was not pleased,1
we've talked about a lot of different symptoms that you have due to this traumatic event or maybe they became worse because of what's happened so I'm like an idea of how much distress this has caused you in terms of social occupation or other important areas of your functioning can you describe that to me,1
have you noticed it interfering in any way with your work or your relationship with your husband or children right not that,1
so what's been different since the last time we talked a week ago,1
so you've been able to cut down by two or three cigarettes that's amazing I mean given how much you were smoking yeah you were able to keep the the journal you guys like you did that and that allowed you to really focus on the time when we were delaying your secret so so that's gone well so one of the things that are not going as well as you'd liked ,1
ok so these automatic cigarettes when you're socializing and you have time on your hands really other problems that you're facing yes and that you've noticed other more difficult than the others ,1
ok so and you thought about already what you might do is such as getting a hobby any other thoughts of what you might do to help you overcome this ,1
ok so from now to the next time you come back and see me what is it that you'd like to to work on  C	I think I just like to do what I did this first week I like the idea of marking it down ok so you can continue with that I and it took me a week and I i'm down to cigarettes a day I figure sure what I'd like to do is maybe go down to five cigarettes in other words another three a day okay and because I smoked a large pack in a small pack maybe just two small packs ,1
you said five cigarettes this time yes and any thoughts about what concretely you could do to make that happen,1
so given what you're attempting to do when would it be good for you to come back and talk about this ,1
absolutely okay okay doctor will see you in a week yes thank you  ,1
then tell me what's been happening since we last spoke ,1
it's going to keep happening that you have to turn down opportunities yeah well tell me honest go from one to ten and how important is it for you to get a job ,1
yeah you're you're it yep you have to provide for your children and tell me how to skip from one to ten how confident are you that you can get a job,1
so it sounds like the childcare issue has been getting in the way into finding something would work for you would be really helpful and then also it sounds like you're kind of feeling not so great about your resume and your experience,1
so if you have if you had consistent work it would change your life in a lot of ways yeah it would be huge it would provide the income that you need and you wouldn't worry so much,1
so everyday you know where you're going yeah okay and you know what's what's happening for the day for the week right,1
because you're you're the kind of parent that wants to make sure your kids are doing well great yeah um so tell me what would it take to get you to like a five in confidence to feel a little bit more confident getting work,1
yeah yeah so having taken care of that part having some reliable child care ,1
yeah so if you had something on a resume that was around education training maybe a certificate of some kind of a field that you're interested in that you would feel proud of yourself yeah well something I could talk about,1
okay what do you have any ideas as to what feels you might be interested in getting some more education more training ,1
okay and so if if you were it sounds like if you were going to do something you'd want to do something really quickly like ,1
okay you know specifically getting some computer skills to help ,1
so whatever and so far it sounds like getting a job is really important right now you really need the money and you really need to take care of your children and it sounds like you have some ideas as to how you could get to these interviews for one and then once you're there at the interview feeling more confident about your skills getting some child reliable child care certainly sounds very important yeah as well as maybe doing some sort of certificate or getting some classes and training in computers yeah that would be great okay okay great,1
well Jim I'm glad you're here I'm kind of surprised to see you're coming back today,1
I'm hearing you loud and clear that being here is not something that's really a high priority for you,1
is alright well tell me a little bit more about that,1
so it seems to you like I might try to push you around and make it do a whole bunch of things you don't want to do,1
so she's afraid that if you take the children with you that you'll be drinking and then you might hurt them or,1
so the fact that your daughter won't even take your word for the fact that you won't drink kind of bites at you a little bit,1
kind of a mystery to you why she'd even be worried about that,1
do you kind of have the feeling that your wife and daughter are ganging up against you,1
yeah you're not here because you think you have a problem you're here because they sent you here,1
that's nice so hearing me say is that you're stressed with all this going on at school and preparing for the holidays that's that big it's really a lot on your plate,1
so do you feel like you but obviously we're this far on this semester how well do you think you've done well thus far,1
do you think if you do what are some options that you see you may have preparing yourself to get the assignments done,1
have you tried anything that might have works in past -,1
it's overwhelming that getting all your stuff inside working out strategies,1
so you put a lot of pressure on yourself when I hear saying it's cool because you like that -,1
do you feel like you've done involve thus far the semester your classes,1
so your primary concern really is for the speak you have to get done this week I remember me just said earlier about creating possibly the creating the to-do list or do you think do you think those things that you mentioned earlier would be good,1
completion with that and going the holiday do you feel like when you do how do you feel stressful week,1
so it seems like you have a lot going on this week but you seem motivated and now to complete it and you have the break to look forward to but you said it so that sounds like you you're almost there you're going to make it so it's good hearing from you [Music],1
why miss Clark my name is Alan Lyme I'm a social worker at the Family Health Center dr. Sheila asked me if I would spend some time with you today I'm really glad that you here I'm just curious as to why he would send you to me,1
yeah so he he actually see me because he went to him for increased stress and he's concerned that your alcohol consumption may be a part of that increase and prior to prescribing you anything you want to make sure that you had someone to talk to about that,1
okay I saw you filled in one of the pink sheets might take a little bit,1
okay thank you so you say here that you have four or more drinks in one week you mentioned that you may be increasing that a little bit as well um and that you have one or two drinks in one setting,1
yeah and maybe monthly you have more than that what what's what kind of drinks do you have what do you drink we need to drive,1
so starting to increase this times drink a little more okay well based on what you put here you give it gives you six points on this scale scale ranges from zero to forty so six points will put you in what we consider an at-risk zone so if it's okay with you lots to talk a bit about that,1
okay so that was sunset run zero to forty it's not it's not a super high risk but it certainly could be a risk for maybe increasing stress maybe some physical Emmas related to alcohol well could start to show up if you were to increase your drinking from there or you can stay there this is a typical standard drink size over here I'm not sure whether that fits your description of a glass of wine a lot,1
yeah maybe the little space that it's upside to drink drink and a half each one so that also increased a little bit more so perhaps maybe drinking more than you indicated on here and for women you healthy woman your age no more than three drinks in one setting is considered to be lower or no-risk and 1/7 in one week,1
how much total in the week and what you say here is that even on this sheet you're perhaps already drinking more than that,1
yeah it seems it seems a little less than perhaps you've been drinking with what you consider to be healthy drinking and certainly there's this conflicting information out there about what's healthy what's not healthy imagine the increased stresses what because we're concerned or to seal as your stresses increases and if you were to prescribe you anything maybe some interaction between the two but also build and serve them I would think so if you would what is it that you like about alcohol,1
so you like the taste of it mm-hmm and it does help to lower the stress signal which is for that time you're drinking one of those so good things about alcohol for you,1
yeah so your financial stress may be increased by the fact that you're drinking,1
22 the drinking to do stress and increasing stresses so the one hand it lowers it on the other hand it's increasing kind of a seesaw teeter-totter effect then what do you make of that give them that on one hand it lowers and the other had it increases and now it's increasing even more,1
yeah imagine you've had some thoughts of that what have you thought of trying,1
and he may be able to I'm not saying that he cannot I'm just imagine that he's concerned that if you continue to drink on the level that you are drinking that whatever he prescribes you there may be an interaction with the to imagine that she's concerned I'm not completely sure so you've had some success in the past with changing behaviors and if you were to decide to make any changes here it sounds like you could drop all that to make those changes how important would it be for you on a scale of 0 through 10 i below the visual here with that if zero is not important tennis is very important to do something about your drinking way,1
mm-hmm let's put it up there why do you choose a 7 or a 504,1
there's a lot riding on your decision in what to do this what if anything will bring up too late online on that scale,1
yeah so so you choose to lower your stress rather than increase it and if lo and your drinking would have that effect that something be willing to do right now how confident are you that you could do something about your drinking,1
okay so it's pretty hot up there again and what if what if anything would you choose to do would be to cut down with a bit to quit just in case but,1
so you'd be willing to stop altogether that's what was indicated by the physician okay so so based on that how ready are you to do anything right now whether it's to cut back whether it is to quit,1
okay so that's that's pretty hot there as well it sounds is that you'll be pretty motivated to do something about this right now given your responsibilities given your children relying at this point and just on on lowering anxiety in general it sounds and that's one of your goals as well well I'm pretty confident that once you decide to do whatever it is you decide to do you'll be able to follow through that based on your experience in the past of of making behavior changes imagine some things that you can draw upon what's one thing that you could do imagine you thought of some things might help to lower your stress,1
one of the things we can't offer here is for you to come in and talk to one of our behavioral health specialists may be able to help you talk talk through this there's a terrible stress and sound like responsibility there and we can make a point for you if you like before you leave today dad talk to someone,1
right it also has some information here if you're interested some a pamphlet on alcohol and and how what healthy limits are and how it may be affected by medications that you took as well and I wish you lots of luck it sounds as though you really committed to making this shift in this change and imagined doctors still wanna fight with you and see how you do with your with your change within a few weeks again I look forward to speaking to in the future,1
how are you doing today I'm Bruce Berger I work on the case manager with your health plan I understand that you came in today to talk about your diabetes,1
well that's yeah it's not just being scared you know I don't want that to happen to me but then one when when she reels off all these things I got to do and I'm sort of you know I'm not certain I can even get it done so it's sort of simple you know I'm sitting here thinking that oh my god this is this is what's going to happen to me as a discourage,1
yes so a slight discard it sounds a lot like on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared about having consequences in terms of everything that can happen what worries you also is all the different things that she told you you're going to need to do to get it under control and I can't imagine doing all those things so you almost feel like all that bad stuff is going to happen,1
okay and I and what I want to do is help you kind of break this up into some some doable chunks so that we can get your blood sugar down on you know on the one hand you're doctors right you know your blood sugar is very high and we do want to get it down so that we don't have those consequences happen and and there are a number of things that you need to do in order to to get your blood sugar down you know on the other hand we can take this a step at a time so it's not so overwhelming and I'd like you to be able to tell me what kinds of things that you can do right now you know for example there's basically three things that need to be worked out with diabetes taking your medicine as prescribed and honestly if I was going to work on one thing right away given that everything seems so overwhelming would probably that do that first because that'll have the biggest impact how does that sound so far,1
because it looks like you need to just take your medicine once a day from from the prescription so that sounds doable right now,1
okay the other things that need to be worked on over time certainly would be changing your eating habits you know to eat healthier not necessarily less but healthier and the other thing would be getting some more physical activity and by the way that doesn't mean going to a gym that means things like more walking maybe using stairs instead of an elevator or escalator stuff like that,1
that really is to give you feedback about how those other things are doing so that it keeps you on task,1
so it helps you know that when you're taking your medicine when you're changing your eating habits that it's really having an impact than your blood sugar because getting your blood sugar down is gonna keep you from having all those other problems how does all this where does this leave you now right now in terms of how you're feeling,1
oh okay alright but before we get started I just wanted to tell you how proud I was a blue and group on Friday night yes that you really really helped Debbie in the role play,1
yeah who's that fuzz it's kind of reverse roles like that you know so I just wanted to tell you that you know the whole group appreciated and you did a great job,1
okay all right well I gotta say you look a little agitated,1
well I tell you what then before we get started in our session let's go through just a real quick breathing exercise just to kind of bring you into the here and now,1
you're not where you were an hour ago you have to worry about an hour from now that's just kind of right here okay can we do that we've done this a couple times in grooving in those practice it now it's sufficient being on the floor there we go put your hands on where you're comfortable you sitting up straight you've comfortable closing your eyes,1
yes all right so let's not clench your hands you go first thing you're going to do is take a nice deep breath and you're going to blow it out slowly through your lips just like you're blowing out the candles on a birthday cake but very slow again to feel the air drove into you sensation on your lips your Grandpa's always your breath is there always there for you to remember that's better you're here and throw it say everything's good so let me ask you question yeah you gonna bring me something or find something,1
oh that's right so we'll go ahead and keep in your lap now you can touch it and help keep you singers and keep you here,1
so now that your little calmer let's talk about what happened with mom before you came here this afternoon,1
alright so it's back and forth in the situate a situation escalates and you slam doors and,1
okay well let's use this situation that has happened to you because today I wanted to actually work on awesome interpersonal would give them and I have a handout sheet to give you and it's called the give technique I want you to take a look at this handout you can take that home with you we're going to talk about this we can directly apply this to what happened today with your mom because this is going to happen again right same situation with your mom so it's a it's a an acronym give giv e why don't you read what those letters stand for,1
okay so this is just something that when a situation starts to escalate you can just say give,1
gentle the interested validate and use an easy manner folks it's something it's really short and quick so in your situation with your mother when she started yelling at you about doing stuff if you thought okay G how would that look,1
okay maybe your tone of voice so if you thought gentle that would probably stop in your tone of your voice a little bit and that would be a good response,1
okay that's very good good what about act interested,1
okay that's important so she knows that you're listening,1
right okay that would be something that you could do quickly and easily okay and what about validate it's an interesting word what what might that how might you validate what your mother is saying,1
yes because you know what if you live together is it important that you work together and get everything done nobody likes to do housework but you all have to do it so does she have a good point,1
can you validate what she's saying that that you do hear what she's saying it's important that you do these things and you know I know that you have a lot on your plate certainly your mother notion have a lot on your plate Taylor right,1
you're dealing with a lot so but you can still validate her concerns -,1
in an easy manner what would that look like for you,1
they kind of difficult to tell a joke in the middle of a heated situation its Butthead but,1
slow down and maybe stay calm and just think that think of the letter e easy whatever that that word easy would make you feel,1
so what are the three what the four letters again,1
easy okay good good good good so you're going to take that home and you're going to look that over all right okay put that go ahead and put that it,1
in your workbook so it's a it's a really easy acronym to remember,1
T you took it breath and kind of like took a step back okay,1
oh well I'm so I'm thrilled I'm so happy and it was quick and easy to remember,1
how did I make you feel to be able to change a behavior like that because ordinarily you would have been cursing and having that anxiety attack,1
I am so proud of you that is awesome Taylor think I am just that couldn't be happier and wait till we tell the group,1
that is no good that would be so good so one more thing I want to give you today one more tool of your little toolkit it's called the opposites and it actually it's in your workbook if you look on page 233 got it if I know anger is one of your emotions that we're working on when I'm is one of our targets here and this has to do with the opposites and you can actually use some of these opposites when you're doing the give technique or when you're doing the stop technique and what it is is that whatever it is that you ordinarily do in response to situations how you react you do the opposite,1
so we're going to practice this we're going to practice more a group but I want you to kind of get an idea of what it is today so let me ask you a question when you feel angry what do you usually do with your hands,1
relax we laugh okay so that would be the opposite of that okay so when you feel like going like that okay or or just keep your hands,1
okay all right let's see what says your stomach muscles in your chest when you're angry what does that feel like,1
so if you want to do the absolute opposite of that what would that look like,1
deep breath deep exactly it's hard to take a deep breath when you're like that,1
good that's good good good okay what about your face what if what happens when you're angry you're G you're,1
you can let your two together and you know Brown in and tight so what would be the opposite of that,1
maybe a little smile two little eyes you're up to it nothing fake but this is all meant to be behaviors that you do on purpose so maybe you feel yourself like this you can do it all at once,1
and that's something you can choose so got a lot here that you're in your little toolkit for one session so I want you to add this to your homework list,1
I want you this week to make a list in your journal of the times that you've used your stock technique you've already used at one so go ahead and you can put that could be your first entry,1
and when you use the opposites of a happening and what I want you to do is first put what preceded what that was happening before you decided to use it for this technique so whether it was an argument your mother or somebody cut you off you know you're getting stressed about a homework assignment whatever happens to be what happened before which behavior you choose to use which skill set you're going to implement and then how do you sell afterwards okay and it made you feel calmer happier got along better with your mother you were able to finish your assignment without anxiety that whatever that happened to be,1
and I also want you to at least once a day do your breathing technique,1
okay even if it's just for one minute just to bring you back into the here and now just to bring you into the present and to know that you can breathe and your breath helps you to remain calm okay sounds good all right it seemed very different than when you walked in here half an hour ago so it's um it's good I'm happy for you to it you're making progress I am very excited for you okay I love your little first scarf ever wish I had one just like it,1
okay Tamra so I just finished reevaluate your gums,1
and we did your scaling and root planing just a few weeks ago,1
and I wanted to let you know that we didn't get the response that we were looking for,1
so I wanted to ask you on a scale from one to ten ten being the best on being the worst how important is it to you,1
okay what do you think it would take to move you to a seven or an eight,1
okay so tell me what you know about the relationship between diabetes and gum disease,1
that's true that's true that's good the relationship between your gums and your diabetes if your diabetes is not well controlled it's not it's not a good thing your gums tissues tend to be more irritated they believe much more easily your gum disease progresses much quicker and how long has it been since you've seen your doctor,1
okay good sounds like you're really motivated and you're doing some research and kind of staying on top of it that's you know trying,1
good what would you say is your biggest challenge for keeping it well controlled,1
okay well I have a couple of suggestions and I think what help is that okay,1
okay the first thing I think would be a good idea would be that you put your medication near your toothbrush,1
I don't probably I need to be you know more like a seven or eight because it is really affecting you know my cleaning and everything if I don't take my medicine and don't you know get my diabetes under control,1
in the session before we were talking a little bit about your alcohol use hoping you could you could tell me a little bit more about that,1
did you stand out that party is being more intoxicated or was everybody intoxicated,1
have you ever had any legal or work or social problems because you're drinking,1
do you find it difficult to to get alcohol like you have to work to find it no,1
last session we spoke a little about your alcohol use over the last few months and I want to get some more information on that if you could tell me a little about that,1
so last weekend you didn't plan on drinking and you you drink you dragon and more than you it would have normally,1
has has this alcohol use interfere any other air in life socially or an employer or anything,1
so when you're when you're talking earlier you'd mention that you were feeling anxious lucid anxious trouble sleeping look like you're shaking a little bit there was this a result of you cutting back,1
our last session we got to speak a little bit about your alcohol use you're telling me a little bit about that but I'd be interested in hearing more I feel comfortable continue with that discussion,1
I want to talk to you about some of your symptoms try to figure out what's going on with you,1
we're talking earlier and you mentioned you had some some thinking that was thoughts that were bothering it okay tell me about those,1
okay the CIA's using your cell phone to track your activities,1
so I asked you and you ever ever see or hear things other people can't see or hear,1
okay so like an idea how this impacts your daily life can you tell me how this these recurring thoughts about the CIA even affect how you function from a daily basis,1
okay so it does seem like it's interfering with your functioning a little bit yeah I scan the way of your daily routine,1
okay uh can you tell me how many times that this has happened to you we have these recurring thoughts about the CIA do you remember any other times,1
I want to talk a little about the symptoms you've been having lately,1
you had mentioned earlier that something happened and you had some symptoms that bothered you can you explain that to me,1
when you let me clarify and say you were hearing your hand talk to you was she there,1
you know what she was saying I didn't make out words,1
is that something she's to say when she was around which was a lot,1
you have any idea what my brought these symptoms on,1
can tell me what happened after those two days that when the voices stopped,1
okay so since you've had since the voices stopped you really haven't had any problems,1
do you remember any occasion before this episode with the guy attacking you and then you have the voices with something like this that before,1
I ask you some questions out what's going on and see how you're feeling you tell me what's going on,1
I got a little bit of an idea but I really don't know I need to hear from you,1
what what has happened that makes you believe the CIA's is following,1
they are here that's because you can hear the or you can you said earlier you could hear what they're talking about it here's something,1
you can hear them and you can see that the shadows that we've on the ground,1
so an let me ask you it sounds like this is disturbing you how long has it been going on,1
is every time you didn't have this happening we see I wasn't chasing you,1
how about when you were younger was there time when you didn't feel like they were bothering in,1
they've always with you this information has been useful thank you,1
well so you're doing your best but but pretty pretty disappointed in the way things are for you these nights not seeing a whole lot of its kind of kind it is kind of your life isn't it I mean you guys kids what it is ,1
for spore small kids and one of them being baby nuts and ,1
gosh gets to a point where you pretty much give up ,1
with still having the priority of you know safety you know you're still looking out for her that way but it's kind of gotten you you're getting kind of worn down,1
oh gosh I'm sorry it's getting that point pretty pretty pretty helpless,1
provides maybe a temporary temporary escape but it never doesn't change anything all right so whatever what are some other things that you're doing that maybe you feel are helpful ,1
well its own so long and so you liked it you like to read and you liked write yeah and and kind of the classic thing that happens right when you when you start to feel depressed when you start to really get depressed that's exactly what happens the things that we really enjoy the things that really fulfill us are the things that we that we start to not do anymore even though it's like even though you know you've always enjoyed it I you just don't feel like doing you just kind of get to a point where you're like just you know it's not like I saw you perk up I mean you talk about it your eyes just lit up you know the way you talk about you like to write and you have a passion there so it sounds like that's something that if you if you were doing that that would be an indication that you're you're doing better you feel good ,1
well I and I think we all experience that I mean it's that kind of you know even though it's something you like sometimes it's it does take kind of taught it does take time and it takes energy and when you're tired you know you don't always feel like it and that's part of it too is it that you know i i'm sure the writing in and of itself is a very rewarding thing but then it's in order to write you have to have time to yourself and it sounds like that's something that you sure don't have much,1
well I heard you mentioned earlier something about your husband some concerns you're having about the relationship so so maybe just to get a sense of there are a few things going on I mean one is you've got the feet feeling pretty down feeling pretty down feeling pretty overwhelmed with being a home all the time with the kids and not having time for yourself not having a break not being able to get away so one is you don't have the time to get away like you don't have many opportunities when you do you're pretty well exhausted and don't really feel like doing the things that you have enjoyed in the past like reading and writing and then so one of the things you've done to try to cope is is smoking marijuana which you know seems to help for a little bit but then when you come back it's everything's the same and so it seems like you're not getting a tremendous amount out of that and then you've got your husband who you're in this you know you've got real concerns real questions about what's going on with him and you're not feeling entirely supported and and you've got questions about its fidelity alright,1
so out of everything out of all of that I mean what do you think is the thing that how do you think we could best use our time,1
so certainly I mean that would influence a lot of the other things and I mean that would hell I'm you'd be getting out of the house and you have money and all those kinds of things any of you thought about kind of like how that would work in terms of taking care of the baby if you had a job you'd be able to maybe someone to help out with the beach ,1
yeah you got you've got a real plan in mind okay i just got to get out then the four job okay i have all my right of the main everything is ready but I just Evan at a time,1
hi Sandra thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes I understand you don't have very much time but I really appreciate you stopping by,1
so I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about but that overall coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter so can you tell me what was it that made it possible for you to even come in what were some of the things you were thinking about ,1
so the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking ,1
and it sounds like you're smoking setting an example those are some things that that you're also a bit concerned about but as you said earlier not not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately ,1
so Center what's good about smoking what do you like about it,1
okay so is there anything else that you like about it,1
so let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking the things that you like about it and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out okay so it sounds like it's a way to relax it's a way to socialize with your friends from work and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke ,1
you also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight and concern that if you were we're going to quit smoking what that would do in terms of gaining weight and that smoking after meals is pleasurable that it's something that would be really hard to give up yeah I also heard that it's very much a part of your life it's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a nonsmoker does that capture for you some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking ,1
so I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking what about the other side can you tell me about some of the not so good thing ,1
Sandracan you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her ,1
so this morning that experience it really brought home how she does watch you and she does really look up to you and notice what you do how did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you ,1
and again thanks for your honesty and talking about this I appreciate that this is a this is a tough topic this is a hard behavior to think about giving up I guess one thing that one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that you know the one hand you talked about how being a good parent is your highest priority it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter mm-hmm and on the other hand I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief socializing and it's something you can't imagine ever changing how do those two things fit together ,1
so what would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important that raised it up in the list of priorities for you  C	I can't think of anything right now okay I don't have any plans to quit it's just something I'm thinking about,1
so it's not so much that you don't want to quit in a way it's almost how could I do it that would work for me exactly okay I appreciate we we probably used up the time that we have I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this is that something that would be helpful oh sure,1
good talk about tomorrow not necessarily the most exciting thing for you to do but I appreciate you're willing to do that can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week I promise it's not too time-consuming we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change why you would even consider quitting smoking and then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days ,1
okay here you go thank you so thanks for coming in Sandra we'll see you next week all right  ,1
hey Marissa it's nice to see you again I'm really glad you came back I am this is about our second session and last session we kind of talked about you and some just a little bit about you and we left off about you know where what you and your friends do on the weekends and you had mentioned the alcohol so this session I thought we could talk about what you do on the weekends with your friends and you know how much alcohol you guys are using and kind of stuff like that does that sound all right yeah good so let's get started so can you tell me a little bit about what you guys do on the weekends,1
okay can you tell me a little bit about the difference a pleasure you get from the weekends you're drinking alcohol to the weekends you know I,1
okay so there's kind of some pros and cons to both sides of drinking and not drinking,1
okay so what are some of these things that you do like about alcohol,1
mm-hmm so it sounds like when you're drinking a little too much it's kind of turns into a bad time but you just drink you're right about the right amount or just a little bit you're have fun with your friends and you know not not getting into too bad of situations that's not about right so what are some things that you don't like about drinking,1
okay so you're saying thank by staying at some friends houses and you know kind of watching out on trust when you're drinking alcohol and but you're you know something so I'm like they're still kind of happening and even with after kind of planning us out,1
yeah peaking definitely outside I can just can't imagine the feeling so I'm sorry you had to experience that,1
can you tell me how often you have thrown up from drinking alcohol,1
okay so on one side some of the things with alcohol or you know it creates you to be a little relaxed and carefree and have fun to dance but on the other hand you know there's a little bit more cleaning involved to be safe about it and sometimes you know you drink a little bit too much and that can cause it down on your night for you or you know how to take care of a friend,1
okay so earlier you had mentioned that a couple times that you had had to some decisions with limiting your alcohol and you know that make it as safe as possible why don't you think that you uh did that,1
yeah but something you kind of get a good head on your shoulders and respect must be a big value to you,1
okay so do you think that drinking kind of fits in with that value or how does that fit in with your value of respect,1
okay so you're kind of looking at balancing you know how much you can drink with some positive benefits without crossing over to those negative sides so what have you come up with at this point do you sort of stick to a limit,1
okay so you pretty much it feels like it works for you and you kind of have it spelled out where you know it goes smooth so you're sort of balancing that and sometimes do you ever exceed that limit,1
okay so a portion of the time it's working in the other portion the time it's kind of like you just go with the flow,1
okay so kind of thinking on those lines how important is it is it to you to make some changes or adjustments to your drinking when you're looking at your values or maybe your future plans,1
okay so you may find it hard to stop drinking completely because they're drinking around to you but if you might find it easier if you just lessons about of drinking but your friends wouldn't support you either way it sounds like,1
yeah won't be no good for all of you guys to kind of do it together so you kind of have a goal to set back them out of you drink how important is it to you maybe on a scale of one to ten one being the not that pour in at all so you tend being the most important thing to you right now,1
okay so why would you pick a six or seven may be compared to a four,1
okay so you're just kind of making those changes when you feel like it's gonna fit ninto your life,1
okay so looking ahead you kind of thik that drinking wouldn't really help you with those goals,1
okay so how confident are you that you can make these changes on a scale of one to ten one being not confident at all and ten being the most confident you've ever felt,1
Wow so 10 is pretty pretty big so why do you think you picked a 10,1
okay so maybe you had mentioned you'd like to cut down but you have to have the right timing and it's got to be you know 100 percent you're doing it,1
okay so what else do you think you could do with that how could you you know cut down on your drinking,1
okay so sort of you know playing activities that might not include alcohol as much and kind of getting your friends on board with being okay with doing this alcohol or those activities without alcohol okay so do you feel like this is a goal that you could maybe set and be willing to work on,1
okay well would it be okay if we met for the next couple weeks and kind of worked on this goal together,1
okay well your commitment to changing you know kind of this behavior and you know making a commitment to chat really shows that you're going on to the next step and you know making a change for you know maybe the better for your life if that's what you know it's for you so does that sound like that's kind of right,1
okay so I'm just gonna do a little summary it sounds like you're kind of studying big goals for yourself like becoming a doctor and graduating high school and go to college and I'm really looking forward to you know see how you do and I think you'll do great and looking forward to school and it sounds like you have a pretty good social life and you know you're pretty active in sports from what I heard earlier for my last session and that all these benefits can help you you know maybe from cutting back on alcohol with maybe you know bettering your school performance and really helping your health and you know possibly you know helping you find belonging with your friends without having to have alcohol and also it's really exciting to have a really good plan in place as long as you're willing you know I would really like to be real working with you,1
all right well Dana I want to welcome you back into my office I appreciate your willingness to come back this week it was really a pleasure to get to know you a little bit last week and I really do appreciate your willingness to be so vulnerable with me I know it's not easy to just spill your guts with a stranger so I really appreciate that is there anything that I can do right now to make you a little more comfortable okay well as you know you're more than welcome to use the restroom if you need to while we're having our conversation so if you do it's just right around the corner I also want to briefly remind you of our confidentiality rules and I told you last week that I always just like to reiterate that everything you say in this room will be completely confidential the only reason that I would have to break that as of course if you were to tell me that you have an intent to harm yourself or anyone else so last week you talked a little bit about what brought you into the office excuse me and why you're seeking treatment with your use of marijuana um I heard you say that you're having increased difficulties with your asthma as a result of your smoking yes is that about right,1
okay well you're a primary care physician thought it might be helpful for you to come talk to me a little bit about your asthma and your use of marijuana because he's I think he's worried about your use of marijuana with your condition which you agreed to come speak with me so am I on track here so far,1
okay all right well perfect well since we discussed a little bit about your history last week I want to begin this week by discussing the cravings that you experience and maybe what we can do to help cope with some of those cravings in other words maybe develop some alternatives to smoking do have these cravings how does that sound,1
okay well let's just start a little bit by talking about your cravings the cravings themselves when you wake up in the morning you start your day when does a typical cravings start for you,1
okay can you tell me a little bit about what that's like for you,1
okay so the types of planning that we typically do to help these cravings include components of reminding ourselves of maybe the negative consequences that come along with these behaviors so another component would be to find alternatives to this solution so when you wake up and think who I know I'll be more calm throughout the day I'll be more relaxed at work maybe could we try to remind ourselves of the negative consequence that we discussed last week like I'll be more likely to be late to work if I sweat this morning these are just some examples of some ways that we can help remind ourselves throughout the day to maybe combat these cravings but I know maybe that's easier said than done like I'll wake up and just tell myself that it won't be beneficial you know sometimes that's easier said than done so another thing that we can do is find very specific alternatives to the smoking so we could look at other activities that may provide this relaxation and calming feeling that you're describing would you have any ideas about I know we talked a little bit last week and you're going to think about maybe some alternatives were you able to come up with thing,1
okay so I hear you say that you don't see how discussing alternatives will help you stop smoking,1
okay so nothing else that you can do will relax you as much as marijuana does,1
okay so what would it be like for you if we were maybe to just explore some new activities or new techniques that could provide you some relaxation,1
okay well that's understandable change is hard and it's hard for a lot of people if trying something completely new would be too difficult maybe we could find something that you've tried in the past or liked in the past I don't want us to choose anything that would be uncomfortable for you so let me ask maybe what kinds of activities have you done before that brought you the sense of being relaxed and peace,1
okay I know you mentioned last week that you started smoking about a year ago would it be fair to assume that you stopped running around the same time you started some anything,1
okay so you said that you were a big runner what role did running play in your life,1
okay so it sounds like running really helped to bring a sense of relaxation to you,1
okay so what let me ask you what would it be like if we were to bring running into your life again,1
okay well I want you to take a second and imagine what it would be like for you to running what would that look like if you were to imagine that,1
okay so Dana I'm hearing you say that running brings you a really great sense of calmness would this be something we could set as maybe homework for next time like in between our next session now in our next session for you to try running again to replace the calmness smoking brings to you,1
okay well I appreciate your willingness to consider it I know you said it's a bit awhile and it takes some courage it really does to get back into something that you haven't done and as maybe has gotten a little unfamiliar so I appreciate that,1
okay well perfect that sounds like that's really would be a good fit to improve your asthma which is what brought you here in the first place and then maybe help you cut down on the smoking does it sound about right to you,1
okay awesome I'm wondering if you'd be willing to do something else for me so we're gonna try the running and I'm wondering if you'd be willing to journal maybe after a run so say if you chose to run three days after work next week just jot down a couple things like what it was like to start running again or if you were to think about any of the cravings or just your treatment in general just what it was like to go running again for you Kasana you mentioned last session that you really used to love journaling and reading and so that's why I bring it up because I know you used to enjoy your journaling,1
okay okay well it sounds like we have a solid plan in place how are you feeling right  now about our plan and today,1
okay well I'm hearing you say that you're excited to try this is that what's out there,1
well I want to thank you for being so open and honest with me again today just like last week you know it's hard to just open up to a stranger so I thank you again for that and I'm really excited to try this new plan a few Dana I'm excited to grow with you and help you in any way that I can in this journey so next week we'll review your journal and discuss kind of how running was for you and hopefully maybe help them with these cravings and divulge a little bit into that a little bit more how is that sounding,1
okay well how does next week about the same time same place,1
I'm well thanks for asking  soyou say you're doing okay what's going on ,1
tell me about some of the foods that you've been eating have been leading to this problem ,1
so let's talk about for a second I'd like to the kind of your relationship to this problem how do you view this problem ,1
it's in control all right so Nate I won't ask you a couple questions about that the importance and the confidence of changing clearly you have some desire to change or you wouldn't be here ,1
so if you are looking at a scale of one to ten one was it's not important to change and ten was it's extremely important change this is just how important it is for you to curtail your eating  * very important to you yeah it's very important okay so what if I asked the same question except this time you're confident so one is you're not confident all you can change but  you're very confident could change,1
so it's below the blow the scale of one to ten this is yeah so you end of no confidence at all ,1
so on one hand you'd like to you'd like to stop to eating it's important to you the other hand you don't believe you can do it I,1
have there been any other changes you have been able to make say in the last few years that have been positive,1
so you had some small successes in terms of making changes what do you think makes the this I'll just refer to as the food problem so much more powerful so much more difficult to tackle,1
he mentioned before that brownies were the culprit for this last week ,1
okay how about other foods it could be contributing the problem that maybe you don't enjoy as much that's chocolate ,1
pretty much any candy yeah so of of the candy so I want to focus just on the candies and not there the food is just for now the thought of like I introduced the idea is stopping eating chocolate how it's react to that not gonna happen ,1
how about the let's let's go for example with the skills what if I've introduced the idea of stopping the consumption of skills,1
oh you could it's up to you whether you or not but if i enter just that idea of stopping the consumption of skittles how would you react to that  C	I don't really understand why ,1
well it represents a change in the direction that you want to move ,1
but we know we know that's an area that did you know you can't really make a change right now what you're saying like us the idea of stopping chocolate is not going over well with you know it's not gonna happen and that's fine but the idea of stopping skittles that's fine that doesn't seem as daunting no,1
would you agree skittles on save the  scale that it's important to stop skills,1
alright so this is a change that you think you could accomplish even though you're not sure it'll actually contribute to solving a larger problem,1
well I would hope it's something that that you would want to do I mean what I want is one thing what you wants really important here is this something that made our skills part of the problem yeah small yeah right no pun intended right in another small but it's a small part problem but your degree still part about,1
not a huge change but it's one that we can work on all right I want you to build to you know genuinely buy into the goal I mean if you don't think it's important we can talk about other areas change ,1
you think you could stop eating skittles but you don't think it's going to solve the larger problem or lead to exactly all right but that's what we have to work with right now because the larger problem is not something you mean the way you put it is it has control yeah yeah so if I are just the idea of stopping brownies no no no sorry isn't that so let's let's go after the change that we can achieve in this case it's not perfect it's not ideal but it's what you can do fair enough sounds like a plan so so for this week i'll see you again week for this week just just continue eating skills it was skittles all right let's go ahead and let's see let's see how we do with that change does that seem to make sense yeah all right so work with that and I'll see you can we thank you thank you  ,1
you're not feeling like a normal person should be feeling,1
I said you have some anxiety but you're not really certain of the feeling,1
okay I want to ask you a bit of an unusual question that is going to take some imagination to answer I want you to bear with me if you can okay so let's say that we we know you have this problem describing this partially anxiety based at least say that you were to go home tonight and attend to usual chores and you're to go to sleep so you're asleep and sometime during the night miracle curse and the problem you're having right now and its entirety is gone so the next morning you wake up but you don't know the miracle has occurred that makes sense,1
so at this point as you wake up you don't know the miracle has occurred how would you recognize the problem is going,1
I try to try to think that's good trying to think specifically like you first wake up now let's go through let's go through your day say first wake up this miracle is occur but you don't know it's occurred,1
so you don't know about the miracle you wake up believing that you would still have the problem,1
so let's move through let's move through the day and see when you would be able to recognize or what you would recognize so it's different,1
so you may not notice the problems go on when you're still home,1
so the moment you get to work is when you think you'd really recognize that something about the problem has changed that it might be gone,1
so that moment when you start to interact with your co-workers you would you would notice that you're not reacting in the way that you're used to react,1
which sounds almost like almost like intense anxiety or panic will you describe it,1
so so the largest chance you're going to recognize the problem is going is during that in the office first really so there might be an after effect that you would it's going to be absent on your way home,1
but you feel like the symptoms the problem are really strongest at the often,1
so the problem wasn't there you'd be relaxed and confident during these meetings,1
it it seems like I've used to this question which we called a miracle question,1
it seems like it's helped you to identify what's going on a little bit it sounds like a social anxiety type symptom that they have going on,1
that's something we can certainly work on perfect and maybe it's giving you some insight into how that social anxiety seems to function throughout the day when it's more intense at work less less intense as you come home and in the morning we wake up really it doesn't seem like it's too bad at all so it's giving you an idea how those symptoms I've been flow through the day and what they might mean what might be causing them,1
we'll work on it don't work want to put some more framework around it but give that some thought what's going on the problem in terms of when it occurs you kind of you're recognizing habits work and reflect on that a bit and then I'll see you again about a week and we'll start moving through and see what we can do about the social anxiety,1
my name is Christina I'm gonna be the therapist today nice to meet you too so before we start I want to know if it was okay if I take notes ,1
okay great so can you tell me a little bit about why you're here,1
awesome okay so um New York time look it was amazing let's go back to your dad so you said your dad made you come here is that right okay so can you tell me a little bit aSbout why you're frustrated looking,1
yeah totally okay so if I'm hearing this correctly you seem really frustrated because your dad is always making you do things like chores and making you you go with him to places that you don't really want to go to is that right,1
okay so do you think that your dad doesn't understand that you're tired,1
okay so if I'm hearing this correctly you seem really frustrated because your dad is micromanaging a little bit,1
okay so why don't we try something if that's okay with you I want you to talk to the chair like as if your dad was there I want you to tell the chair or your dad how you feel,1
before you continue can you try to talk to the chair as if your dad was sitting there,1
okay can you tell me about how that talked you're talking to the chair talking to your dad,1
good okay so it sounds to me like you're a little frustrated we get that I get a little angry that you are having a hard time with him telling you what to do you feel like you're an adult is that right so you feel like you're an adult you feel like your dad doesn't really understand that that there's kind of an imbalance there okay so I think we had a really good first session I want you if you can come back next week and we're gonna try to figure out how to talk to your dad so he can better understand that is that okay,1
hi Ashley my name is Noel and I am the social worker that is assigned to your case today how are you I'm doing ,1
um first to start the session off with I just want to touch on our confidentiality policy so that entails you I want you to be able to disclose everything that you can to me but I also AM supposed to inform you that if you disclose anything that could either harm you or is going to harm somebody else that I need to inform the proper authorities ,1
um and then I also just want to let you know if you see me taking notes or anything don't be worried it'll just um just sort of help me out stuff like that so um why do you think you're here today ,1
okay um so first of all first of all I want to commend you for coming in here today and taking that first step um so I want to start off with asking do you think that this is a problem for you ,1
sounds like you understand that the problem is progressing um well on a one to ten scale  being the most serious how serious have a problem do you think this is and you're like right now ,1
okay so um I can tell that you'd feel like because your parents don't have a lot that you kind of feel the need to steal in order to kind of keep up socially ,1
so what would have to happen for you to know that this is a problem or move higher up on the scale of how serious ,1
okay well it's it's definitely good that you grasp the possible consequences of jail time and things like that what do you think that the pros and cons of making this change our ,1
okay um so would it be safe to say that friends and family are definitely something that you value,1
um so I think I'm seeing a little bit of a discrepancy between your behaviors and then I guess your relationship with like your family and friends do you feel like these behaviors affect your relationship with ,1
yeah um well what do you think that you could do to overcome these barriers and make it easier for you to change these behaviors,1
yeah definitely those are a lot of good ideas um do you believe that changing these behaviors will be in your best interests ,1
um okay well it looks like we're almost out of time here so um just in between like now in our next session if you feel like you have any compulsions to to steal or anything like that um I want you to kind of focus on these goals and things that we thought about that you could do or like talk to your family members or even talk to your friends about Hannah being a support system and helping you to maybe avoid these feelings that you need to steal and then in our next session we'll talk more about smaller steps to get you going on your way but I think we made a lot of progress like this session and so yeah well that's a good place to stop and we'll pick up where we left off ,1
hygena i haven't seen you in a few weeks I know it was hard for you to come today and it's kind of a hard process so so I'm really glad that you came today just want to check in and see how things are going ,1
so you've cut a couple times since we've met but not as much as before did have a few fights with your mom so Gina and tell me about where you're at in terms of your feelings about cutting and what your thoughts are about changing that behavior ,1
you have mixed feelings about it it sounds to me like there's some good things about it and you know it is helpful light makes you feel better right away and you're not entirely sure that having a bath and the mini make hid is going to work as quickly or work as well so there's sort of two sides of it for you wondering if the mini vacation and the having a bath will be is helpful for you what did some of the drawbacks to having a bath and doing the mini vacation do you think? ,1
so it's maybe not as immediate for you you have to draw the bath that may take a bit more time yes it's a different it's different what are some of the good positive parts about how choosing to do have a bath and self-soothe in that way do you think?,1
it's maybe a big one for you right that you're waking up your don't have any scars you got to listen to your music you got to you're smelling good right you're feeling good maybe ,1
so you listed lots of positives but it's you know there's still these two parts of yourself remember in some of the other sessions we've had we talked about what Eugenia person what you value and what's important to you do you remember what those things where we thought we identified?,1
so independence and privacy were important to you in terms of you know what you value in your life so when you think about independence and you think about privacy where do you see cutting impacting that like how does that fit with those two things how does cutting fit with independence why don't we start there ,1
so you there's independence in terms of those choices okay any consequences of cutting on your independence do you think ,1
so that you are in control but it doesn't work out for the best yeah and there has been some consequences in terms of your mom curtailing your independence based on your cutting ,1
so your mom was sort of pulling back on your independence when and it gets into a bad cycle ,1
it becomes a real vicious circle almost like yeah how will privacy what is how does cutting effect privacy for you that value? ,1
it needs to happen in private and that being wanting to be in private at cutting those two things go together but the downside is that you're almost required to be private because you have to hide yourself and be so conscious all the time of covering up and keeping the secret so you talked about having mixed feelings about deciding to counter not cut there's lots of different feelings for you about that one of the things I wondered about is you know if you imagine what what would things look like for you for you in a year from now if cutting is still in your life do you envision it would look like you know so you'd be one year older Zeb  what do you think when you imagine that ,1
so if just feel like there'd be lots of consequences down the road there'd be lots more scarce maybe more spots and really afraid that it wouldn't be an option to go on the swim team that big bad for you ,1
so you have hope right now that you could return to the swim team and that is important to you ,1
all right I'm so you refer to me by Linda Smith and today we're here to talk about your alcohol screening survey that you took that's ,1
with you can we discuss some of them with jeers what you scored in a couple of things  that's okay ,1
ok so here you scored a  which is in the category of risky use so for a women year a woman your age drinks per week  and then drinks per day  so she's going to go ahead and discuss a few things to ask you a couple questions um so what about drinking do you like ,1
okay and then but what do you like about what do you dislike about drinking ,1
okay so basically what you're saying is that we're drinking alcohol you like that it helps you sleep and it calms you in the way you did talk about alcohol that it's very expensive except what you're saying,1
okay okay um so if it's okay with you on a scale from  to  with  being not really not ready at all until being very ready how ready are you to cut back on to cut back your drinking or to quit drinking so from a scale of  to  how ready are you ,1
okay um so what negative things had happened to you while you've been drinking ,1
okay so what you're saying is that then by eating 'king it's led to you sending risky text messages and just better to see a family into your friends that you wouldn't really send if you were sober correct ,1
okay so um I'm concerned about how you're drinking and how may be affecting your health so is it okay if I follow up with you about this on your next visit  ,1
honey I think you have a fairly uncomplicated respiratory infection I don't see anything that would indicate a need for antibiotics what I would suggest I'll give you the name of a cough suppressant that you can buy over the counter and I think it should run its course within the next few days ,1
good I also notice you filled out one of our questionnaires could I look up your question there give a bit feedback that he all right? okay and just to clarify from my information on average how many days a week would you have a drink that contains um alcohol? ,1
okay and only and one or two drinks when you have a drink?,1
in the past three months a notice you filled out our drug use questionnaire can you tell me what drugs you used any street drugs or any prescription drugs in a way that was not prescribed? ,1
okay not about how often would you use marijuana? ,1
mm-hmm and on a typical day that you smoke marijuana about how much would you smoke too many joints?,1
okay all right well your score on this questionnaire is a  out of a possible  points would you like to know a little bit more about what your score means? ,1
we have a little diagram that we use to represent people's risk levels there are people with no use that would have no risk and others that are drinking I'm sorry smoking perhaps on a very frequent or even daily level that would be in a high-risk group but your use puts you in this middle zone which indicates that you do have some risk related to your marijuana use what are your thoughts about that? ,1
well marijuana is a drug that affects learning and memory and coordination and so on the days that you do smoke marijuana more likely to have an accident a fall or if you're driving maybe an auto accident there's some other health effects some of the ones that I worried the most about anxiety and depression and especially paranoid ideations and schizophrenia you ever had any problems when you were out smoking marijuana with friends?,1
okay so that's pretty frightening very yeah well can you give me a little more idea some of the good things some of the reasons that you do smoke marijuana you like to do that? ,1
yeah so it's a social thing something that you do to sort of be a part of the group and it helps you relax a little any not-so-good things you mentioned one thing that's ,1
so on the one hand you have this opportunity to relax a little bit and just enjoy spending time with your friends on the other hand you've got some things that have made you concerned the paranoia really scares you and you're also really concerned about the possibility that get drug tested that might endanger your job so where does that that leave you in terms of continuing to smoke about like you are now or maybe quitting or reducing what you're doing?,1
yeah might be time to quit yeah you know as your physician I would say that's a great decision because none of these bad things would happen T as least as a consequence of your drug use if you quit quit completely so I think that's a that's a great choice what would you say if if you go out with your friends? you sounds like you do that on a regular basis next time you go out you say no I how are you gonna say no?,1
put a little thought into that some people talk about their health or problems that they've had or some people just say I made a decision I don't want to do yeah yeah you can kind of think through those and come up with something that you think would work for you and your situation and the people that you go out on with ,1
so someone were actually upon expiry yes yeah so that may help them understand well I think that's a great decision Tonya as i said i want to give you today some information i'll write out the name of that cough suppressant for you okay and you know i'll see you for your next annual vision when that comes due or are you know how to find us before then if you need us ,1
good well thanks for talking with me about this today I know these are not the easiest things to talk but I think you've demonstrated some really clear thinking and let me know if there's any way I can help ,1
hi Chris I thanks for coming in today and filling out our survey I wondered if it's okay if I go over a couple of things that that you answered in the survey ,1
okay one of the things that I noticed is that you are not using any kind of birth control right now ,1
okay and I just wondered if we could talk for a few minutes about some ideas and and I wondered what what your thoughts are about using condoms,1
you've heard a lot of negative things about condom usage okay so Chris it's okay if I share with you some of the things that I've learned about condom usage and some of the things that my clients that are around your age have shared with me about condom usage ,1
what some people don't realize and don't know about condoms is that may not only prevent help prevent teen pregnancy but they can also prevent sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia along with HIV they're really effective in preventing these things and there's also a lot of easy ways to get condoms these days that some people don't know the local health departments have condoms and many times they're free and local pharmacies drug stores have condoms and there are a lot of clinics that have them as well either for a small fee or sometimes they're actually free and there's some some ways too that people have found carrying them around pretty convenient you know in their car or in their pocket because they're pretty small what does it sound like as I'm talking what are some thoughts that are going going through your mind ,1
okay we're not interested in and coming a father right now I'm guessing ,1
okay great well can I ask you so after this conversation today on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being that it's not at all important to you and 10 being that it's extremely important where do you think you fall with how important you know taking a chance in using condoms with you now.,1
okay okay well that's great it sounds like you really have you know a plan in mind what do you think you'll do next like what do you think would be a next step with you as far as contraception and condoms,1
okay we have an open mind to them okay well we've got some here at the clinic would you like me to give you some on your way out and you can just take them with you,1
Great well thank you so much for talking to me it was nice to meet you,1
So you're saying a lot of people get to your eyes and these are really their problems. ,1
So what's that mean to you to hear that it's a problem. ,1
It sounds like you then dealing with this type of thing for a while. ,1
so your boyfriend having some issues.  It's hard living apart. The issue is if you like to go out and spend time with your friends I mean he's concerned he may treat you so much concern for he says you're often brought carried out or you block out someone you are going to fight right so far right and.  T;	So what is a typical night out looks like for you.   ,1
So you enjoy taking showers and you.  I would like to summarize you told me this far I want to make sure I understand everything you said and if I had understand something incorrectly for.  Those So far you've told me you're here for counseling because you referred to this here as your very DUI and you feel if you mean singled out so are you all treating your I mean I'm sorry really a problem for most people it's out sounds about right so far.  ,1
pretty good actually added well let me introduce myself properly mines colon I'm one of the registered nurses working here at the center I particularly work with clients or thinking about changing their behavior in some way but I should address you Bob what name would you prefer mr. Jones,1
so okay like see you're a coach or something like that or,1
yeah so I wanted to get started if as a few things we just lay out before we get going yeah so my understanding is that you're here to talk about your substance use and i do want to point out that anything that you say to rise will be kept confidential and in the sense that we don't discuss your business needlessly i do share information with other members of the healthcare team and if they tell me anything that it sounds as though you rather pin yourself at risk imminent risk are putting someone else at imminent risk of harm or indeed that a child might be at risk then I do have a statutory responsibility to do something about that okay is there anything I've said so far that you want to ask about,1
I i understand it sounds good i mean i understand so yeah yeah well there are some specific questions that we ask of everyone boomer and doing this first kind of a meeting Nathan but before getting to that I'd like to put that aside and begin just by hearing from you like what brings you here well,1
well quite a few things going on for you there then the idea that you've been getting irritable we've been hurting people that you love even and and you mentioned also missing some job opportunities so some work opportunities ,1
so could you tell me more you've been partying your wife's being an upset with you well going on ,1
so you think that perhaps you've been drinking too much,1
well you've given me a lot of information so far but some of the things that have brought you here ma'am you've talked about not a bit missing job opportunities you've talked about and be getting irritable and the noticing you had been different and even hurting people that you love you've also mentioned that you've been drinking a bit more part in a bit more and also using some cocaine and I'm wondering what would it be helpful for you to focus on today athan what would be good for you to talk about now ,1
so so quite a few things going on then it's you know you've suggested it from Europe for your copious so you're not remembering things that you know you're putting yourself at risk and it's scary for you ,1
your family your wife your friends are all really important to you ,1
thinking about importance Nathan how important it be for you to make changes to your core cues,1
yeah it's good to use imaginary scales absolutely so so for you ten would be the the most important and deal with people yeah okay yeah so you're roughly eight ,1
I mean it's very important to you then I wonder why is an eight and not let see a four,1
so sorry it's like there really are a lot of good reasons for you to to think about changing ,1
so and certainly our labels aren't alcoholic labels aren't important what what what do you know about cocaine and alcohol and how they work ,1
and I guess one of the issues that I really wanted to highlight is that when alcohol and cocaine get used together which is reasonably common but for among cocaine users and what actually happens is that when alcohol and cocaine mixed together they form a third substance and actually has some surprising effects it can stay in your system a whole lot longer and can also give you a feeling where you don't feel as drunk as you would normally do and sometimes that means you can drink to excess and not even realize you've done it ,1
Wow I mean I didn't I didn't even know that it's surprising well you know see the thing is that that makes a lot of sense because that kind of that makes that makes more sense because it explains why I end up spending more money and you know and having no alcohol left and in in the house in the morning and stuff like that and,1
I guess so for you if you were to stop one it'd be the cocaine it's looking that way I mean I guess especially if you know if the alcohol and the cocaine makes like you say they doing and all that so thinking about stopping how confident are you that you actually could stop if you wanted to you told me earlier was very important to you ,1
how confident you are and I may be again in an imaginary scale of  to  where  is the most confident one is the least confident ,1
so there's somewhat competent then I wonder whites for and let's see no a one ,1
so a lot of your your friends use and it could be quite tempt and you're sure you could stop ,1
I suppose there are some things you could do to help yourself stop then,1
these are great ideas Nathan you've told me quite a lot this morning so far and I Anna certainly want to hear more about your your own ideas about what would help you to stop I'm i did mention earlier that i had some specific questions to ask you and I wonder if now might be a good time for us two million if I summarized everything that's been said so far and then maybe we could switch back to these specific questions how would that feel for you that work ,1
yeah that's okay yeah okay let's let's do that then okay Nathan so you've told me quite a lot of horrible things that have been happening since you began using cocaine and particularly become concerned about your recent years as you've noticed that your moods been quite irritable that you're hurting people that you love that you've been missing opportunities for work you've not been sleeping very well you've also told me that you've been taking some finished off at risks and that scares you and also not even remembering sometimes for what you've done which i guess is also really scary you've told me it's very important for you to start using and you've also indicated that you have some confidence that you could stop in fact you've even come up with some strategies does that sound about right to you  ,1
answer some questions and trying to do a self-evaluation about how you're feeling around alcohol on the contraception ,1
okay so we're working on  point scale of one to ten one being not important can be very important one being not confident one being very confident so on a scale of one to ten which number best reflects how important it is to you to drink the low-risk lifts,1
you'd say an eight okay and on a scale of one to ten how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below risk levels,1
okay and so let's look at those to hear you're thinking it's pretty important but your confidence is down here but a four but it's not a one what makes you confident that you can drink the low risk levels under you remember what those are ,1
okay so that gives you good reason not to drink okay anything else ,1
so you have a support group that gives you the ability to have funded still drink yeah below risk levels ,1
let's look at your self evaluation of your birth control of use so now we're doing the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control so on the scale of one to  how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to keep from getting pregnant ,1
okay and on a scale of one to ten how confident are you at the present time to you that you can use detective birth control every time every time we is sick correctly as its prescribed,1
ok so you're pretty confident that you can do it and why are you s  and not a  or  ,1
ok so it's kind of link to your drinking the fact that that you can if you can take care of that drinking you can take care of the earth control issue and this importance comes down as your reason why you're not down here yes very good so it looks like you're using a good method of birth control you're just not able to use it effectively and you've linked it back here to the drinking so would you like to develop a plan around your alcohol use of this today before I leave,1
ok and if you need more information we can get that for you ok,1
wanted to talk to you because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures from a party we're at and made me a little bit concerned because I saw you were drinking and I wonder if you can tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits in your life ,1
it's kind of a social thing for you not like a major priority yeah how much do you think you're drinking ,1
so you're drinking maybe half the time depending on what's going on that weekend yeah I guess you can say that well how would you describe the difference between weekends when you drink versus ones when you don't ,1
okay so you you feel like you get more stuff done on weekends when you don't drink but maybe you don't feel like you can relax as well ,1
you're trying to be responsible and get your stuff done yeah knowing that the drinking is gonna make it harder yeah and it sounds like are you getting everything done or some stuff sort of slipping when you drink ,1
what are the things you enjoy about the drinking ,1
okay so you feel liberated or kind of more confident in some ways yeah yeah  ,1
okay are there any not-so-good things about drinking ,1
how much do you think is the most you've ever drank in one time ,1
that was out of the ordinary for you don't just count what's a more typical amount that you drink ,1
got it so you're you're sort of testing and pushing it and yeah and sometimes crossing that limit and having some of the consequences that you mentioned yeah,1
okay what kind of along those lines looking ahead you know five years from now what do you see as a goal for yourself in terms of career wise in terms of what do you think you'll be doing in five years and I would love to be I would,1
so getting a full experience is really important to you it sounds like throughout your life we talked about wanting to make the most of your high school experience and now you're looking ahead to think of how you can enrich your life in other ways ,1
okay so just to kind of summarize what you've told me so far you're you're drinking pretty regularly but you are trying to limit yourself you feel like three drinks maybe is probably the maximum that you can drink before you're having some of these negative consequences and it and you feel better if you limit yourself to three or less yeah I feel more in control mm-hmm and then kind of looking ahead you you don't want to find yourself being someone who's drinking all the time or someone who feels out of control what they're drinking that you've seen that maybe in other people's lives and it's not appealing to it all and and you do have some big goals for your life that you want to achieve that drinking too much could also interfere with so where do you think you want to go from here with your with regard to your drinking ,1
so for right now it feels like a reasonable goal for you would be to sort of limit your drinking and make sure you're you're stopping at three for example or maybe even limiting the number of times that you're drinking ,1
okay what do you see as some benefits to that benefits intelligence is sticking to those limits ,1
yeah I think taking steps to limit and cut back on your drinking is a really good idea you know I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about it and being open and honest pleasure you know if you don't mind I would like to talk to you probably about this in a couple weeks or a couple months just kind of check in how things are going right all right sounds good thank you very much  ,1
well Terry I think I have a pretty good idea of what's going on with you you got some anxiety that's related to not having enough work to do in the economic stress that that's causing for you let me ask you about something else sometimes use of alcohol or drugs can contribute to anxiety I notice that you filled out one of our drug questionnaires could I take a look at that and maybe give you a little feedback? this one that's right yeah that's it okay and let me just clarify how much alcohol or drugs you might be using on average how many days a week or month would you have a drink that contains alcohol?,1
okay so zero alcohol yeah no very good no risk related to that I know she did fill out our drug questionnaire though could you tell me in the past three months what what drugs you've used any street drugs or any prescription medications in a way that was not prescribed? ,1
on a typical day how many joints or blunts would you smoke?,1
uh-huh okay yeah what's some of the good things about smoking marijuana? for you most people who smoke do it because they as does something good for them,1
so mm-hmm that's um what other good things about smoking marijuana for you? ,1
let's get some pain relief from it um what some of the not so good things for you about smoking marijuana?,1
what are the not so good things if any about smoking marijuana?,1
stress or conflict there because I'm definitely that yeah so on the one hand it does give you some me time and an ability to kind of get away and relax and maybe manage your back pain a little bit better right on the other hand it's a it's had some big job consequences and in addition to that now scream friction in your relationship with your wife and as you physician I can tell you one of the medical consequences of smoking marijuana is that sometimes it actually increases anxiety sometimes just from the drug itself or sometimes as it's going out of your system you get a little withdrawal symptoms related to to the anxiety so you've got some good things some not-so-good things where does that leave you in terms of continuing to smoke to see them out or maybe cutting back or quitting?,1
well let me ask you on a scale of zero to ten zero would be not ready to make any change or ten would be on I'm really ready to make a significant change today where would you put yourself in terms of being ready to cut back or I'll quit your marijuana use?,1
yeah so you've got some things that are really making you think about it yeah well let me tell you what I thought we might do with your anxiety today I thought we might start you on a medication that's very safe non addicting I try probably some sertraline medicine that you take every day and slowly it's not going to take away your anxiety immediately but will slowly bring down the anxiety level in your life and then we also could engage in some counseling if you're interested somebody who could help you learn to deal with stress think through the issue of what to do about your marijuana use and also do some marital counseling between your wife if you lie what do you thoughts about?,1
I will take it and think about it and if you decide you want to do that just give a call back here to the office we can set that up,1
what about a next step for you in terms of your marijuana use what would you like to do about that?,1
well Terry I think that's a good plan I'll write your prescription you can pick that up at the desk on the way out start taking your medication if you and your wife decide you want to go for with the counseling just call back to the office here and we'll set that up I will see you in three to four weeks and I have a handout for you that I'd like to give you it has a lot of medical facts about marijuana we find a lot of people are not familiar with all of the different medical and mental health complications you can get from marijuana but it's something we'll give you a little bit more information to think about ,1
okay very good and I'll plan to see you back in three to four weeks,1
so where you said you'd like to start Sal is talking about your asthma and specifically about your dog and how one is affecting the other,1
hmm so what can you let me know or or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse,1
okay and that your pet has never been mentioned as a concern ,1
hmm yeah and I I can see that you've already worked hard to make some changes you've almost quit smoking you're just down to your last couple of cigarettes and you're not even smoking those in the house and your house is totally smoke-free ,1
yeah okay and you have also thought about cutting back on alcohol and and I think you mentioned done done a little bit towards ,1
okay so now almost like that's not good enough like now you have to douse the dog and I mean and now what what's next,1
okay so I mean there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar you know when he's in the house or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him what happens with your asthma symptoms ,1
hmm so it doesn't make total sense to you that that it's all Oscars fault and then that's the only solution,1
I also wonder whether regardless of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been such a big part of your life for so long ,1
mmm yeah and and in the end you know whatever you whatever you do about Oscar about your asthma about all the other things that we talked about on that agenda setting worksheet I mean you are in the driver's seat salad it really is your choice ,1
there's a lot of decisions and a lot of change with your wife with the new baby and and now thinking about looking after your health and wanting to be healthy for your wife and your baby ,1
mm-hmm so what what would need to happen or how would you know when you win or if you ever did have to make a decision about whether to keep Oscar with you or not,1
yeah and it got the feeling that it's something that you want to think about that this is a really big decision and it's not one that you're gonna make in a hurry ,1
okay so let's review some of the things we talked about last week um what were some of the reasons why you came in ,1
okay and we talked about a few solutions like working on your time management skills and I did suggest that you go see a doctor about the possibility of having a DD and we did talk about the possibility of you enrolling in the u.s. I counseling center so have you thought any more about those options ,1
okay and so I ask you to think about the pros and cons so what are some of those that you came up with ,1
okay so taking out time out of your day and the money are obviously some big concerns that maybe we can look into you and we're gone but what would be some positives of doing that ,1
the Counseling Center they provide a service or you're able to,1
okay so um now while those are obviously some things that would help you what are some things may be stopping you from doing those already because clearly you know that those are things that are available to you but what stopped you up until now,1
okay so they would help improve really socially socially and a work as well because we didn't talk about some more issues that came up throat okay um now what are some positive attributes that maybe you think you already have that can help you make these changes now what are some things about you that make you think you can definitely do this ,1
okay well I don't ever try to leave any things left undone ok so maybe thinking about those maybe we can apply those to you no more ways to motivate you to make those changes and get towards your solutions ,1
okay hi there hello my name is Michael Biehn and i am a chemical dependency counselor here at active recovery what's your name down below pinch be okay and that's what we know is that spelled because according to this we have our pick work here that we have it done this is Donald Augustine you preferred honor Donald preferred on that's both aug  aug e and s T is T I make sure yes make sure we get that corrected okay basically today this is this this is an initial intake session we want to kind of determine some of your needs and what ultimately brought you brought you herVI received a call this week from your general care practitioner and your neighbor he was concerned but before he was concerned mainly about prescription medication use but before we get get into actually be more interested in getting a little bit ,1
okay okay how are you go if I start on how you're  you look really healthy good very healthy Bush won last year why yes sure are you do you have a family are you married ,1
when they did here is ready are they doing that you think you've ever say it better as you go along how many children ,1
yeah wow that's that's that's quite a quitter we're going to turn gotta try to hold those nation there that's good that's really are you retired ,1
yeah I bet you have a lot of life experience it's it's been interesting that's great it's great so tell me about your troubles with her,1
so moving around seems to help you have less pain it's but when you're sleeping at night or you're staying in one place you have more pain ,1
okay how does the prescription medication fit into your lifestyle right now those last one I see here that you have your taking oxycontin or the taking oxycodone pushes a generic brand new do you realize that's an opiate it's the same this is a painkiller it's similar to what how that a coat of opium is the same thing got an opiate they would make similar to heroin and a lot of people take opiates different kinds of paint further pain medication problems and they hurt their back or they have injuries do you realize that it's highly addictive ,1
yeah it's uh it sounds to me I mean how long how often you take are you taking it is you you're taking it as prescribed is that correct what should ignore your daytime and i can't wait them and say you take you find yourself more you've been finding yourself taking work how much is that increase over the last last one half ,1
okay and have you talked to your doctor about possibly increasing the dosage what you doesn't want to do that so I hadn't go to their doctor to get you more ,1
so now you're seeing two doctors to work with the pain medication right for your back ,1
and that's so that you can get more is that because the first doctor won't give you communi give you enough ok and he gave you as prescribed in the beginning a specific amount and if he go he did he did well he gave you a specific amount and he's not willing to go any further good woman they could okay and so but you felt that you needed to get more difficult Lee okay so you went to a second doctor together to get more okay I'm just trying to clarify to make sure that i understanding correctly has heaven do you know what tolerances loaded with black people no tolerance is and when it comes to medications and drugs and alcohol so when a person would take a certain amount of medication or they might take a certain drug or they might drink a certain amount and they would continue to increase the amount and as time went on their body could only take so what their body kit would want more it's like creating one more and more and over the last month how many times have you increased your medication we could really keep track Tyler to the right foot listen let's narrow it down ,1
okay so it it's only lasting two hours and it's posted last hour motion much hold for four hours of time but it's only lasting two hours and then you're taking more increasingly and so your date or how many times have you increase that dosage on your own couple times ,1
so you should you should take it every four hours and you've taken it took it over to every two hours and how many pills to build two pills so technically you're supposed to take it every four hours so in a -hour period you're taking it about five times or six times maybe and what you were you were prescribed to Kazakhstan ,1
okay and sat down and now you're taking it a total of twelve times ouch ,1
all right it sounds can I make a suggestion or can I give you a little bit of feedback it sounds to me like it is that you're increasing that you've increased your tolerance because of the amount of pain that you're having you've increased your increasing a tolerance level for the medication handle so much medication and you're building up a tolerance now for it that's the beginning stages of addiction and I wouldn't say that you're in too bad a shape at this point or anything but what concerns me is that you are increasing your amounts of medication regularly you're seeing a second doctor to get more deep do you see a problem or discrepancy with my backers ,1
all right you you have taken medication that you took over the prescription hands against your doctors for or orders on them and then you saw a second doctor to get the second amount medication you're building up a tolerance and a resistance to the medication if you continue to take the medication at this rate where do you think you'll be in the next  days okay right now you're taking medication at a rate of taking you started off with one let's take two pills okay originally at your six times a day every four hours I believe I'm doing my math right ,1
and you increase you doubled that in at one stunna against the wishes of your first doctor and you spoke to a second doctor is your first doctor note about the second doctor what about the second doctor so they don't know each other they don't know ok so that's a problem in a bits out there that ,1
it's because you're you're in pain but you can crease your mouth over this last month if you continue on this trajectory continue moving forward doing what you're doing right now I month down the road where do you think medication intake is going to be super trippy you'd probably be double introduced no double what is now you see a problem with that sounds like at this point right now you're you're you're you're lucky because you're very very early in the stage statements,1
but if you continue forward with it it can become an increasingly highly addictive problem and you would you would need a formal treatment inpatient treatment at this point you that's not necessary impatient Rick we what we would need to do is determine boy or like for us both determine what we could do to manage the pain slow down the amount of medication you're taking before ,1
would you well first of all first thing I would like that is on it at this point right there on the scale  to   being least important  being most highly important where where do you see yourself right now as high as important as this how important is it for you to change your current path help with that quick pretty close for joining a time ,1
okay would you would you be interested in possible pain they're seeing that they're just because I I can refer you to a therapist that helps with pain management it's not medication base it wouldn't take you off your current medications that would help you manage your pain better through several techniques and therapies it's relatively low cost and expensive and the money that you'd be spending to increase your medication you actually be saving by seeing the pain being retired doctor yeah and that way you would have to see two doctors regularly but you can't do some a management as well let me ask you another question on a scale another scale scale of  to  on confidence level how confident do you feel that that you could get some help and change this district,1
yeah it hurts all the time so that makes you look pretty that would be a more under scale so a little bit lower on the scale okay so because your back you think your your back let's talk about that a little bit just for a moment here when you're hurting and your back is hurting tremendously what's besides trying to relieve the pain let's really what's what's going on through your mind well you can never get relief with these lay down or sit down or stand up it hurts all the time hurts a little less when I'm moving around when I'm still more contrary it bothers more right now just having to sit here that's all I nobody tell you about it so do you would you do you want to we talked about you want to consider  shortly then what we want to do is make it would you like to make a goal and follow up about it about a week or so perhaps make a smart home real like what we could do is one have a specific color plan perhaps maybe see I'll refer you to my my reps is verb for pain management specialist do you think you could what's a good time you could probably make an appointment to see him probably tuesday or thursday tuesday or thursday ,1
what's a good time you can come in and see me again  that's weak do you think you can add it in gate you cook ,1
do you think maybe tuesday you can see the pain specialist and management specialists and then maybe CD on thursday just follow just to show check in see how you're progressing ,1
Zack seem attainable an attainable goal for you so far ok and then so we kind of boiled that down so it's actually going to be time times of actually the soul what time on thursday time Jepsen afternoon two o'clock in two o'clock,1
I think that you I mean it still looks like talking to you you I know that you something kind of summing it up everything you didn't at first you didn't see the direction that your pain medication might be taking you in but now you clearly see that it could take you in this direction that could really be harmful to do good okay and that's the pain management might be a better alternative coming coming together with the medication and in a piglet pain medicine and actually is some sort of treatment therapy kind of work on some ideas to try to help you sunny weather swine okay and hope we'll see it and see basically if that works and we can go from there next week we need to get their gear ,1
okay Don it's been really good to talking with you today thank you  ,1
no no hi I'm very hard to I'm very late you're very low okay okay so ,1
I see you've got yourself a cup of tea yeah how do you think I can help right ,1
well well the way you say that sounds like you've tried this in the past and and for once and for all is I'm really determined this time ,1
so you have some internal voices that's disputing probably maybe wait okay with you whether you should or shouldn't exercise and diet look after your health,1
so so sixty percent of the time you don't follow what you really want to do what you do ,1
so sometimes what you want to do is is as distracted by other things yeah and sometimes you find yourself not doing the things that you want to do and you think you're not sure that that might be as much as six percent in third,1
oh well I just don't just stop you there because I'd like you too much to be focused really what is it precisely that you want I mean at the moment it seems a bit vague here tell me what you really want?,1
okay so you you don't want to be thinking about what you're eating just sort of it naturally happens that you eat all the things that give you energy rather than eat things that take the energy way ,1
so much the Health Committee the Health Committee kicks in zone though so you find yourself doing things that aren't what you really want and when you are doing things that you don't really want you've got an internal voice telling you that you're doing this wrong,1
like everybody everybody does you know things that are wrong I mean what differences in range,1
so you've been able to do this before you've been able to what eat healthily take exercise get into size -,1
so okay you clear about that yep and so it won't feel good about yourself and you've managed that before ,1
so you've relaxed and confident eating only the things that can give you energy refusing the things that aren't and then the voice I don't show you,1
that just leaves me a little bit puzzled been really because you clearly you enjoy the biscuit ,1
if you could shut up the voices that were saying now you shouldn't do this man and in there well then you didn't draw the biscuits with you so shutting up the voices is really what you need to do yeah do you know,1
so there's no free showcase they just done yeah obviously not suitable for you obviously not suitable for you so so I mean if you could get bigger biscuits if you could get biscuits that lasted a bit longer yeah and if you could shut the voices off job done ,1
so so you can't happy without you actually taking some steps and done some things there around the road to this sort of this healthy person in a size and if I'm right and thinking is it's not just the  it's the health and feeling good about feeling good about this ,1
well that sounds like you've barely determined to get this done so i suppose what still puzzles me is there you are really quite determined to to make some some good healthy giant lasting long are you really bored and sick to death of the internal diet committee going ,1
yeah yeah so I don't know it sounds to me like you probably you probably you know the only half hearted about their sorry ,1
on a scale that yeah yeah okay so where are you at the moment if if they your success rate at the moment is?,1
I don't know that doesn't seem very serious to me really if you know it's like so yeah do it tomorrow nice do dresses what bullets,1
so what do you need to do to make that leap you know what what I don't know no i'm not sure i'm not really sure that you really are not motivated the biscuits and and they not bothering to exercise seems to be quite quite a nice thing for you too to counter play ,1
then they'd sugar ups and down to Italy and the fat stomach at the long-term effect so flat stomach for teens feeling good by itself and being healthy that's a long term so the short term how to subvert our Thursday yeah yeah and yet that you've still got these voices are telling you you sabotaging yourself ,1
so Tess boring press is the way you've seen them yeah and now what ,1
just my computer okay just give me it's not true ,1
okay so it's not true this is sabores out you are determined you didn't want to make the changes you not really sure now about whether those those boring purity Health Committee voices are useful or not useful ,1
okay ah  C 	Dallas out then understand for myself all the time that for me you know with neutropenia and with just just me my lifestyle and what it is that actually looking after the physical me is just really important right ,1
so those voices were saying that yes and they also cheered you on when you're eating chocolate hey yeah they're nothing don't don't what don't you sort of reinstall this determination to get healthy and fit in and fill good about yourself ,1
so so good to have committee help you were there with the exercise ,1
I'm not I'm just hearing you saying that there's a resource that you could before you thought was a nuisance ,1
yeah yeah yeah ok that's just haha I'm really interested in what you intend to do what what you willing to do to you know to get what you really want yeah oh ok that's well  ,1
well seen my wife's been getting on me a lot lately about trying to improve my health habits and I don't see what the big problem is ,1
okay and so what I'm hearing is that you don't feel like your health is concerning to you right now and about that ,1
so okay have you noticed putting on any weight a little bit but nothing too blue okay okay and how about hope to see his doctor have you gone to visit a bit of dark driving last year for physical but being everything showed up to be following that you feel good you feel good okay that's what I hear is that you you feel like your wife might be overreacting to this ,1
she wants for you to live a long time and be healthy but it's sometimes special you work hard ,1
sure sure okay um and so one thing I just like to do is maybe give you some information on baby obesity or diabetes that you're interested or open to that at your shirt,1
okay but we were talking a little bit earlier earlier in our conversation you had said that you didn't feel like it was maybe causing some of your agitation so it's a little bit of,1
so where are we did did you do you feel like you do have some agitation on the coffee or is it just no problem at all,1
so you see you got some positives the awareness and if you feel kind of on your game and then there's some negatives with you know your coworkers that they don't you know that your boss may not want you you know check it out the hospital floor for yeah yeah and then the blood pressure thing is that sound about right ,1
yeah how about frequency if you feel like you're good on how much coffee you're drinking ,1
yeah what would happen if you if you looked at maybe reducing that with that habit would that get rid of maybe some of the things that are problematic the number yeah yeah but you're training for a day you're probably have that morning cup,1
that's great yeah yeah I think so so you've identified one of the four that might you might be willing to to try for a while to let go of what do you what do you think of that sounds alright so you're sick of this ,1
so then you could tell me about how that's going why didn't do anything yet ,1
yeah I know you've mentioned that in the past when we were talking about the pros and cons of going out to one of these activities you really mentioned anxiety it's a big column ,1
pretty good it's been three months now since you used it's been three months,1
so how last time we talked to you you were kind of cutting the ex-boyfriend now this is dealer so how's that going ,1
so sounds like you made some good changes changing your environment and some your behaviors and these new friends,1
wanted to talk to you um you know you're one of our star athletes really value you as a team player as athletic director one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there and so I went to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now okay,1
that's exactly what I did so here you are you're an honor student your star athlete you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years and maybe last month some time you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first but now you're already noticing some consequence ,1
and stuff like that it's really changed your focus,1
sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though mom got mad at you you're having decreased focus you're kind of not doing so well in school maybe China any other things just different group of friends of group of girlfriends thank you different people than hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of so that's that that's also changed so your your friends that you were hanging out with there's a little tension there now a little bit because not all of them are into that ,1
okay as they are there for me well given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships affecting your studying it's affecting your relationship with your mom right where do you think you should kind of go from here ,1
it it's a big thing your mom is really important to you of course and how she feels about you is important how important is it to you to make an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit a lot ,1
how confident are you that you could actually change or you're drinking or even cut down or quit ,1
on a scale of one to ten where one is not at all antennas completely what number,1
why'd you say eight or nine rather than six or seven,1
all right what do you think is a realistic goal for you then,1
I prefer just make sure your goal is kind of to not drink at all or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very most exact Lee just so I take part with the social convention but it's not hey guys drop doing though yeah Chris they really appreciate you talking with me about this I know it seems like something that's been on your mind as it is and you know like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you so I'm glad we were able to talk about this it really seems like you have a good plan going forward you know really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there is alcohol making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum,1
yeah it's my pleasure as part of my job as part I like best so I better hurry up and get changed for practice  ,1
