T:	well Jim I'm glad you're here I'm kind of surprised to see you're coming back today
C:	well I'll tell you one thing I sit out in front here for about an hour before I come in and that was about that that close just cranking that pickup up and heading back home I'll let you know just like I told rich I'm not real happy about being here I hope you understand that
T:	I'm hearing you loud and clear that being here is not something that's really a high priority for you
C:	and like an etching you got blond hair you know I haven't had a lot of luck with blonde hair last couple of weeks
T:	is alright well tell me a little bit more about that
C:	well I got assigned a probation officer and she's blond-headed gal
T:	mm-hmm
C:	and I think she's out to just destroy me totally you know she's she's talking about me getting a lot of jail time this big fine and everything that she's gonna do if I don't do certain things and I just kind of think maybe you're gonna do the same thing to me
T:	so it seems to you like I might try to push you around and make it do a whole bunch of things you don't want to do
C:	yeah and you know I'm I'm about up to here with this kind of stuff oh I hope you know that probably isn't your fault but I just kind of way things been going
T:	you're pretty fed up
C:	yeah my daughter you know she well let me see the kids
T:	your grandchildren what's that about
C:	well she'll let me see him but she won't let me take him anywhere anymore
T:	really
C:	and and that really has me upset you know she's afraid that all I'll take him hurt him driving around drunk drinking and driving things like that and I never have heard one of them kids hmm
T:	so she's afraid that if you take the children with you that you'll be drinking and then you might hurt them or
C:	get a name and I say that a Dowlen I one drink she still don't trust me now and that's really got me upset nearly got me ticked off
T:	so the fact that your daughter won't even take your word for the fact that you won't drink kind of bites at you a little bit
C:	and she said yeah why you need help well you know when she needed help I damn sure didn't put any kind of conditional you know and and I'm gonna tell she means I need help you know she I've always built around I was helped her financial she needs kids watching anything she needs old daddy's always giving it to her and I don't know where she get my list from this is really
T:	what does she say to you about her concerns
C:	well she says she's fraid dead you know I'll do something that hurt the kids
T:	uh-huh
C:	but I never didn't kids and never have in my life than to thank her
T:	kind of a mystery to you why she'd even be worried about that
