T:	I can I help you
C:	yeah I hope so um my workplace is just gone smoke-free hey I'm not not very happy about it I'm going to keep smoking but I was worrying if there's anything that can help be like get through the day it's like you know go get my beer and smoke cigarettes after work
T:	so your workplace just went smoke free you're not too pleased huh
C:	no I'm not going to quit smoking oh my god I like it it helps me relax so I mean I don't see what the big deal is
T:	okay tell me a little bit about how smoking fits in your day it'll help with the
C:	I mean I suppose a little less than a pack a day it's not too bad um the I probably smoked for the last five years but I I mean I could quit if I wanted to but I don't really want to right now
T:	okay so you feel like right now smoking is a pretty important part of your life it's not something you're ready to change but if the time came when you did decide to quit you feel pretty confident that you could go ahead and do that
C:	sure I can quit
T:	okay what makes you so confident
C:	well I mean I don't see why I couldn't although I have not ever tried to quit I mean it's just something that I do for fun you know I'm breaks at work in the morning and have to work
T:	mm-hmm and so in terms of a readiness to actually go ahead and make a quit attempt where do you think you fall on the scale of one to ten where one is I'm not considering it at all and ten is I'm definitely ready I want to quit
C:	I am probably - I haven't even thought about quitting and until this great announcement at work today I've been totally not gonna quit smoking
T:	okay what made you say two instead of one
C:	well I mean anything's possible I mean I I guess I could maybe be convinced yeah is there something I mean I are there things I can try that would make me like want to quit smoking
T:	well there are a lot of products available now that can actually help you curb that urge to smoke we have products that can help to replace nicotine which can help to decrease withdrawal symptoms that you might experience when quitting or cutting down and also some medications that your doctor could prescribe for you that might take away even some of the desire to smoke
C:	okay well that's good information I mean I'm not gonna do anything today I just need to know my options but that's encouraging if I decided to quit smoking I do have have at least tools to help me quit
T:	sure and back to that skill you mentioned you said you're a - what do you think it would take to move you up to a four or five
C:	I don't know I guess if my friends like if one of my friends decided like quit with me that would probably help too but I all my friends love to smoke so I don't see that happening in the near future
T:	sure I wonder if now that your workplace is going smoke-free if there will be some people at work who are planning to quit
C:	that's a good point I hadn't really thought about that that's a good idea
T:	okay well it sounds like you're really here just for information today I'm happy to help you pick out some of these products if and when you decide that the time is right for you
