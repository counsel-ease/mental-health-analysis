C:	hi 
T:	how are you doing?
C:	good 
T:	well would you mind taking a seat I have a couple things I want to go over with you about this medication
C:	okay sure should have some time 
T:	okay well this should only take a few minutes. so before we get started I just want to make sure I still got all the correct information so you're still on Emma Street with the same phone number and everything right?
C:	yep 
T:	okay so nothing's changed wonderful. um now I was taking a look at your medication profile earlier and it looks like you're on two different strengths of lipitor so that obviously it can't be right 
C:	yeah I don't think no I don't think that's what I do
T:	okay so do you remember which one you're taking?
C:	I don't know you don't know 
T:	okay I think you're taking the  milligram tablets it's not right 
C:	that sounds right and I remember the doctor was telling me that now that's that's what I'm doing now I'm pretty sure okay okay
T:	so the doctor gave you this new prescription but there's new medication, is that right?
C:	I think so 
T:	okay okay so this medication is for your cholesterol
C:	okay 
T:	and you're going to take it once a day it's really important that you take it every day all right and you can take it with or without food it doesn't really matters 
C	yes once a day okay okay
T:	okay and now the doctor did tell you this was your cholesterol right? 
C:	yeah he said that's why I checked my blood last time that's why I was in for a visit
T:	right right exactly so that's why he wrote you this prescription so it's greater cholesterol you're just gonna take it once a day it's really easy. Okay, there are some side effects that go along with this medication but I wouldn't really worry about it because I mean you're young you're healthy it's not an issue so don't concern yourself with it. Okay all right so just to make sure that I didn't miss anything I'm just gonna repeat everything again to make sure you got it first time okay all right so this medication is for your cholesterol you're gonna take it once a day you can take it with a lot of water and you want to make sure you don't miss any doses okay okay 
C:	okay
T:	what questions do you have any questions at all?
C:	no should be good okay 
T:	well if that's it I guess you can go ahead now so here's your prescription
C:	thank you 
T:	all right have a nice day
