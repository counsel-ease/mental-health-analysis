T:	then tell me what's been happening since we last spoke 
C:	well I did get an interview for a job 
T:	that's so great 
C:	yeah but I wasn't able to go because my kids I didn't have any one to watch them and you know so that was sort of game over I just I had to cancel the interview and this it's too bad because it was really actually was a job that would have been good but I don't know 
T:	sound disappointed
C:	well yeah because it's it's you know I didn't really have a choice I just have to be have to make sure my kids are taken care of first and you know worried that this is going to keep happening
T:	it's going to keep happening that you have to turn down opportunities yeah well tell me honest go from one to ten and how important is it for you to get a job 
C:	it's it's about out of ten because yeah I mean I'm the only one supporting my kids and you know it's just I what I'm getting from welfare is just not cutting it so I really need to have job and soon 
T:	yeah you're you're it yep you have to provide for your children and tell me how to skip from one to ten how confident are you that you can get a job
C:	I mean right now I think I'm bad with a three I just seems like you know even if I'm able to get into the interview and get childcare you know when I show up I've got this resume that it's it's not impressive and it's got all these gaps of employment and I'm not as educated as other people going in for the same job so I just feel like I'm not I don't know that employable 
T:	so it sounds like the childcare issue has been getting in the way into finding something would work for you would be really helpful and then also it sounds like you're kind of feeling not so great about your resume and your experience
C:	yeah yeah because it's so limited and I've been out of the workforce and even when I was working I mean it's not I don't know it's not stuff that I feel like can lead to the job that I want now
T:	okay what is it that you want 
C:	I just want something that is is going to be steady and where I can me you know even if my kids are in childcare during the day that can be home every night and spending time with them and I really like to get something where I'm just making good money and and I don't have to worry all the time about money yeah 
T:	so if you have if you had consistent work it would change your life in a lot of ways yeah it would be huge it would provide the income that you need and you wouldn't worry so much
C:	yeah and it'd be nice to just know what I'm doing and just have my routine right
T:	so everyday you know where you're going yeah okay and you know what's what's happening for the day for the week right
C:	one it would be good if I knew you know that my kids are taking care of - yeah so I'm not worried about them law in the work right yeah 
T:	because you're you're the kind of parent that wants to make sure your kids are doing well great yeah um so tell me what would it take to get you to like a five in confidence to feel a little bit more confident getting work
C:	well I mean being able to make the interviews would be the priority again um so try you know taking care having some child care I mean having someone I trust that I can call when I you know what that interview because you definitely need to go to an interview of in order to get three
T:	yeah yeah so having taken care of that part having some reliable child care 
C:	yeah definitely not
T:	what else would get five 
C:	um I just wish that I had I had more experience or um you know more education it seems like everyone's got a college education and I don't have that on my resume okay I get asked about education and training and um you know just as soon as I asked about it I just feel just like I'm not good enough okay this does not have that
T:	yeah so if you had something on a resume that was around education training maybe a certificate of some kind of a field that you're interested in that you would feel proud of yourself yeah well something I could talk about
C:	yeah the interview too you know even if I was some type of certification where I could say I could you know with confidence talk about about that mm-hmm
T:	okay what do you have any ideas as to what feels you might be interested in getting some more education more training 
C:	I mean I guess I just don't really know what it's going to be because I need to have a job now so I'm not really sure like what's going to be fast right I almost feel like that's more importance and what I'm interested in you know because I'm like I'm not going to go back to school for four years right now
T:	okay and so if if you were it sounds like if you were going to do something you'd want to do something really quickly like 
C:	yeah short a short certificate yeah or something yes something that I could get immediate skills that would you know get me into some kind of a job now even if it's not my long-term goal or you know career just just get me into something and then I how focused on yeah sort of like a short-term or transition into something else yeah great exactly but that would be steady and pays well mm-hmm okay and allow you to afford everything ya need to because even those jobs right now I don't feel accessible for me they seem like you know seems like if maybe if I were better on the computer or
T:	okay you know specifically getting some computer skills to help 
C:	yeah I think so okay I think so because I don't I can't I don't really have anything on my resume that talks about the technology yeah okay
T:	so whatever and so far it sounds like getting a job is really important right now you really need the money and you really need to take care of your children and it sounds like you have some ideas as to how you could get to these interviews for one and then once you're there at the interview feeling more confident about your skills getting some child reliable child care certainly sounds very important yeah as well as maybe doing some sort of certificate or getting some classes and training in computers yeah that would be great okay okay great
T:	so what would you like to do next you
C:	think well I'll find the childcare resources is seems to be the batsman's of it that's a priority the priority because I can't even do an interview without that yeah and then I guess getting into some type of some type of a training program that's you know shortly maybe there's a weekend
