T:	good morning mrs. Smith just need to get your blood pressure can you roll your sleeve up for me how are you doing today?
C:	oh pretty good always busy this time of year but keeping up. How are you doing?
T:	great... all right your blood pressure's  over 
C:	that's good right?
T:	yes 
C:	good I've always been really healthy 
T:	well not always it looks like you got a letter about your ac and you haven't been taking very good care of your diabetes
C:	my what?
T:	your ac it measures the amount of sugar that's been on your hemoglobin in the last three months to determine how well you've been controlling your blood sugar 
C:	oh yeah I got that letter but I didn't really know what it meant and I never really pay attention to my diabetes because I feel fine. How bad is it?
T:	it well let's see today it was eight point seven and three months ago it was . so normal is less than six your way out of control 
C:	well like I said I've been really busy this month 
T:	well your health is something you have to make time for. Have you at least been taking your diabetic medications?
C:	not really I'd rather use diet and exercise 
T:	well it looks like that's not really adequate so you need to be taking your medication. Diet and exercise sometimes just aren't enough your chart says that you've been prescribed metformin which is a long lasting medicine that will keep your blood sugar under control all day. I think would be more effective than just diet and exercise. Are you testing your blood sugar?
C:	um yeah sometimes 
T:	okay how often?
C:	Oh once every few weeks but I feel fine so I don't think it's that bad
T:	we'll remember your ac was high like I said earlier and that's a much better indicator than how you feel so um it showed that you were out of control if you don't start making changes you could permanently damage your eyesight blood vessels even have to have a foot or leg amputated 
C:	oh well I would definitely do something before it got that bad but I'm not interested in taking those medications I'll try to eat better or something 
T:	I don't think you realize how serious your diseases 
C:	I don't see how I can be so sick if I feel fine I don't want to take medications
T:	just because you feel fine doesn't mean you're healthy having diabetes affects you more than you realize and some people feel fine when they have a big  old sore on their foot 
C:	well I remember my doctor telling me something about the symptoms of high blood sugar like feeling shaky or tired but I never feel shaky and tired 
T:	well those are symptoms of high blood sugar but you can have the high blood sugar without those symptoms that's the whole reason for doing an ac to determine if your blood Sugar's been out of control and your ac showed your blood sugar has them out of control 
C:	I get what you're saying but I feel fine  and I don't want to take something that's not going to make me feel and better I mean what if it makes me worse when my grandfather was on heart medications the levels got so high that he almost had a heart attack 
T:	heart medications and diabetic medications are very different you can't generalize the experience your grandfather had to this medication they're completely different. Will we at least try again taking your medications? 
C:	I don't know I'll think about it alright 
T:	well we'll see you in a few months then
