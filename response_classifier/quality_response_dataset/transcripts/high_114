T:	hey Sally oh how are you?
C:	I just fine thank you 
T:	good so how is it they going since our last appointment?
C:	well it's been really busy for me I went back to school and I you know with the kids and all the activities I've just been really friend to great now I'm going to add that but 
T:	congratulations on all back to school that's huge 
C:	thank you 
T:	welcome so recent I want to get together to kind of touch base and see how things have been going since your last appointment I know at that time we talked about flossing and there was some inflammation your guns and you're going to incorporate flossing in your daily routine and so I'm just seeing how that's been for you
C:	well I started off good after our appointment and then you know after in the evening with dinner and then with the homework with the kids and trying to get them to bed I you know I've just not been very good at keeping up with the frosting understand and 
T:	that's common it's a very hectic time frame so so what do you what is your routine like in the evening?
C:	well we do dinner actually I try to get that work done with the kids before dinner and we have dinner and then they need to read for their homework and then I try to get them to bed at a decent hour 
T:	okay well how do you feel about flossing after the kids have gone to bed or after dinner before it gets real hectic when you start but not goes to bed?
C:	I hadn't really thought of that i always think about flossing you know right before right exactly before and I hadn't really thought about other times probably 
T:	since you since you're so busy and it's very hectic in the evening and it might be beneficial to change the routine to wear when you have a down moment incorporate the flossing at that time okay how you feel well that you think that would work for you?
C:	I think that would work i sometimes I take a few minutes after i put the kids to bed and watch a little TV that's a down moment
T:	okay people how do you feel about frosting while you're watching TV?
C:	oh that wouldn't be too bad 
T:	no a lot of people are no thing that they have to be in the bathroom or have to do it right before they go to bed but be honest as long as you're removing the plaque and debris from your teeth before you go to bed it doesn't matter if you do it right after dinner or if you do it you know before you go to bed as long as it's being done and we totally 
C:	sure 
T:	so yeah I think that might have you feel comfortable about incorporating in your routine 
C:	yeah I think that would work for my schedule I think I would make it a lot easier for me to get it down to where I do it every day 
T:	well great great okay well what we'll do is today we'll go back and we'll take some measurements of the pocket depths and cannot do and see where your gums are today and then when you come back in three months we'll check again and I think you'll see a huge difference and you'll see the benefit of glossy and you know what the benefit is for your again 
C:	okay I'm excited I think I can do this 
T:	I know you can be great okay let's go back
