T:	okay finish the exam have some good news and they have some not-so-good news looks like you don't have any cavities so that's the good news
C:	that's great
T:	however I'm pretty concerned about something I'm noticing in your mouth actually if you look up here a roof of your mouth I'm noticing a lot of irritation that's really consistent with tobacco use and you had said on your form that you're not a tobacco user so I'm just wondering what's going on
C:	I don't smoke cigarettes
T:	okay well as I said there's a lot of irritation in particular like I was mentioning up here in the roof of your mouth it's turned really deathly white colored and there's little red spots and you probably didn't notice because we don't spend a lot of time looking at the roof of our mouth but you're really damaging this tissue in your mouth which can really cause some severe problems in terms of your oral health it's called nicotinic stomatitis and this is something we don't see in any patients who don't use tobacco so maybe you're not smoking cigarettes are you smoking a pipe or cigars or is there something else they will be contributing to this because I don't know what else might be causing it
C:	well the only thing I've never smoked cigarettes ever but when when I go out with my friends we like to go to you know we'd like to go out to lounges and and you know sometimes there are those those nice young men that gift you different sorts of things and we got some of those mini cigars that swisher Sweets they come on peach and and grape and and you know that's the only time that really you know I've ever really used anything that that's got to pack Oh in it
T:	okay so I think that's a pretty common misconception because they're fruit flavored people think they're okay those are really bad for you did you know that
C:	I'm really bad but they're just little mini little cute little girly cigars
T:	right there still cigars and there's still tobacco and so they still cause lung cancer oral cancer emphysema all those same kinds of things that you would see with cigarettes
C:	boy only if it were just to relax I mean it's not like it's something that I would smoke 20 or 30 cigarettes a day I mean I only do it when we go out
T:	uh-huh well that's I mean at least you're not doing that so that's good but it's still causing a lot of problems and as I said I can see that the evidence in the roof of your mouth you're causing some serious damage and this needs to stop have you thought about quitting
C:	well I didn't really know I'd started
T:	what do you mean
C:	I didn't really think that it was anything more than just like social drinking just something that I do in a social setting when me and my friends go out to the bars
T:	so you're going to quit then
C:	oh maybe
T:	what do you mean maybe I just told you how bad it is for you it's messing up your mouth you're putting yourself at risk for all these other diseases this is really important you need to quit
C:	well it's something that I'll have to think about
T:	what's there to think about you said it's not that something you do all that often I'm there's all these negative side effects there's all these risks that you're putting yourself in
C:	well it's just something that I do to relax and I don't with that often and so I probably could cut back
T:	okay well that's a good start but cutting back isn't going to do it if you actually quit the smoking you can reverse all the damage you've done in your mouth and you can stop yourself from from being at risk for these other diseases but as long as you're continuing to use these cigars you're really putting yourself in a lot of danger
C:	well I don't believe that their cigars and what I do believe is that it's a choice and it's my right and it's something that I choose to do and so I will think about cutting back but I'm not at a point where I'm ready to do that and I'm not really sure that I even believe that what you're telling me is real
T:	you're choosing to really damage your mouth and actually it can cause problems with your teeth too I don't know if you notice your teeth might be getting yellower than they were before that's another side effect there are a lot of really negative things that go along with any tobacco use whether it's cigarettes cigars dip to snuff snooze hukkah any of it this is a really important decision that you're making and you said it's your choice but you're really choosing to make yourself sick and potentially die
C:	well it's something that I'll think about
T:	well I appreciate you thinking about I hope you'll think about it really hard you know this is something that I'm going to continue to ask you about because it's something that really needs to change
