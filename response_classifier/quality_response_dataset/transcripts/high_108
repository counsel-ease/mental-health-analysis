T:	hygena i haven't seen you in a few weeks I know it was hard for you to come today and it's kind of a hard process so so I'm really glad that you came today just want to check in and see how things are going 
C:	been in a couple fights with my mom cut a few times but not as much as before 
T:	so you've cut a couple times since we've met but not as much as before did have a few fights with your mom so Gina and tell me about where you're at in terms of your feelings about cutting and what your thoughts are about changing that behavior 
C:	I know it's bad but I don't sometimes I just want to do it because I know it'll help me feel better right away I don't know that having a bath will make me feel better right away necessarily if 
T:	you have mixed feelings about it it sounds to me like there's some good things about it and you know it is helpful light makes you feel better right away and you're not entirely sure that having a bath and the mini make hid is going to work as quickly or work as well so there's sort of two sides of it for you wondering if the mini vacation and the having a bath will be is helpful for you what did some of the drawbacks to having a bath and doing the mini vacation do you think? 
C:	I guess there's nothing bad about it really I'm just used to having that me release when I cut 
T:	so it's maybe not as immediate for you you have to draw the bath that may take a bit more time yes it's a different it's different what are some of the good positive parts about how choosing to do have a bath and self-soothe in that way do you think?
C:	it's relaxing it I get to be clean and smell good again listen to my music like it's sort of like a treat for me so and I don't wake up the next day with scarves 
T:	it's maybe a big one for you right that you're waking up your don't have any scars you got to listen to your music you got to you're smelling good right you're feeling good maybe 
C:	yeah 
T:	so you listed lots of positives but it's you know there's still these two parts of yourself remember in some of the other sessions we've had we talked about what Eugenia person what you value and what's important to you do you remember what those things where we thought we identified?
C:	one was independence and two was privacy yeah those are the main things 
T:	so independence and privacy were important to you in terms of you know what you value in your life so when you think about independence and you think about privacy where do you see cutting impacting that like how does that fit with those two things how does cutting fit with independence why don't we start there 
C:	I decide to cut myself and it's my own my decision 
T:	so you there's independence in terms of those choices okay any consequences of cutting on your independence do you think 
C:	it's not a good thing yeah I'm in control but it doesn't work out for the best 
T:	so that you are in control but it doesn't work out for the best yeah and there has been some consequences in terms of your mom curtailing your independence based on your cutting 
C:	definitely she takes away my independence and so it seems like a bad cycle 
T:	so your mom was sort of pulling back on your independence when and it gets into a bad cycle 
C:	and then which makes me more mad which makes me want to cut again 
T:	it becomes a real vicious circle almost like yeah how will privacy what is how does cutting effect privacy for you that value? 
C:	it impacts it in a bad way because I have to be private about hiding my scarves but it's kind of a good way to because I get to do it in private nobody else sees me and so I feel good about having that private thing but only I can do 
T:	it needs to happen in private and that being wanting to be in private at cutting those two things go together but the downside is that you're almost required to be private because you have to hide yourself and be so conscious all the time of covering up and keeping the secret so you talked about having mixed feelings about deciding to counter not cut there's lots of different feelings for you about that one of the things I wondered about is you know if you imagine what what would things look like for you for you in a year from now if cutting is still in your life do you envision it would look like you know so you'd be one year older Zeb  what do you think when you imagine that 
C:	just feel like it will probably be worse I feel like I'll have way more scarce like they could even be somewhere else not just my arms right maybe my legs because if I just keep going then there'd be nowhere else to cut and they just could get really bad I think lots more scars I would not even have a chance of going back on the swim team at all for doing anything like that I think it would be bad
T:	so if just feel like there'd be lots of consequences down the road there'd be lots more scarce maybe more spots and really afraid that it wouldn't be an option to go on the swim team that big bad for you 
C:	yeah I feel like right now I could probably go back if I stop cutting but if I keep and once I heal it could be okay but if I keep going the way I'm going I don't know if I could hide it and might stick around forever 
T:	so you have hope right now that you could return to the swim team and that is important to you 
C:	yeah
