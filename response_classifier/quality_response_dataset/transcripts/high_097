T:	so now I want to talk to you a little bit about some of those answers I said we would get back to okay so firstly I just want to just summarize kind of way you said that you've tried smoking cigarettes one time didn't like it you've had a few drinks a few different times over the last year at some parties and you also got a ride from someone who you knew was smoking marijuana did I get all those ready right yeah okay all right so I want to say that you know it's a good thing that you seem to not like smoking seem to have decided that you don't want to smoke I hope you would continue to you know to decide that you don't want to smoke it's also really good that you don't use anyone else's prescription medicines I know it's really tempting in high school with your busy schedule and you know just trying to use things to help you study to help keep up with your busy schedule so it's really a good thing that you that you've also avoided doing that but it really it is concerning about your drinking so i just wanted to hear a little bit more about that from you so could you just tell me a little bit about your drinking
C:	well it's not really that big of a deal it's just on the weekends i have a couple of beers and i think the main thing was the homecoming when I just got a little scared because I didn't remember parts of that night so and like my friend they threw up so it was kind of scary
T:	okay so just to clarify so it sounds like when the one hand you know you kind of drink to fit in at your friends I'll do it that you felt kind of would help feel a little bit more comfortable in this date but on the other hand just being afraid of some of the consequences and seeing friends get sick or kind of a negative for that well well I am concerned about your drinking you know just so you know we used to think that people's brains were done developing by the time you were  but now we know that they develop well into your s and alcohol really can have an effect on developing brain cells probably that time where you didn't remember everything you did that night we call that a blackout and that's usually an indication that there's some subtle effects of the alcohol in your brain cells so so again that that's concerning not to mention that often people do things that they later regret when they're drinking so so just to think about all that and really I would recommend that you not drink at all until you turn  okay so I mean just to think about that but if I had to have you put on a scale of  to   being not at all interested  being very interested where do you think you'd be as far as your interest in stopping drinking right now 
C:	that sounds like a good idea probably like nine or  
T:	okay good so now I just want to talk also about driving with the friend who was smoking marijuana yeah I mean just to make sure you understand it a lot of times people may seem fine but really they're not especially with the the skills you need to drive safely so so that's something that you one to avoid here 
C:	I'll just call my parents next time I need a run 
T:	okay yeah i think you know I've known your parents for a long time and I think they'd be understanding and willing to do what they need to do to come get you so good okay what do you have any questions no I think that's good okay so what I want to do is have you come back in a couple months and just check in to see how you're doing with with not drinking so let's see how that goes and you'll come back in a couple months and we'll we'll see how that way okay so good
