T:	no no hi I'm very hard to I'm very late you're very low okay okay so 
T:	I see you've got yourself a cup of tea yeah how do you think I can help right 
C:	I'd like to once and for all stop even thinking about what I do to my health I just do the right thing does it certainly 
T:	well well the way you say that sounds like you've tried this in the past and and for once and for all is I'm really determined this time 
C:	yeah whatever else happens I just want to shut up the Health Committee in my head but you know rub it's on at me about dude don't because I'm largely very good at looking after and by half of me really I mean diet and exercise what I eat and how look after my body 
T:	so you have some internal voices that's disputing probably maybe wait okay with you whether you should or shouldn't exercise and diet look after your health
C:	well as earn full I like to exercise and I feel good when I exercise  and I'm in the habit of getting the habit of exercise for about only forty percent of an average week when I look at it so for forty percent spine isn't it I mean it's more than I do no it's not I want to like when I say forty soutar would that mean in terms of time I mean only forty percent of the time do I really follow what I've said I'll do what I like doing what I want to do 
T:	so so sixty percent of the time you don't follow what you really want to do what you do 
C:	I talking idea man identified said she's exactly right but it feels a bit like that feels like I know what I want I go in you know a bit of coaching on some stuff I set out to do it I feel really good when I do it and then I very easily seem to let it go because um it's evening time or on the way traveling or something 
T:	so sometimes what you want to do is is as distracted by other things yeah and sometimes you find yourself not doing the things that you want to do and you think you're not sure that that might be as much as six percent in third
C:	yeah I think I'm kidding myself thinking I'm on a good track sometimes 
T:	oh well I just don't just stop you there because I'd like you too much to be focused really what is it precisely that you want I mean at the moment it seems a bit vague here tell me what you really want?
C:	i want to write what I honestly want is to fit into all my size  trousers thank you and I want to feel good about myself and whatever I I almost want to not even think about what I'm eating because I just eat things that give me energy to the things that suck my energy or make me blueberry 
T:	okay so you you don't want to be thinking about what you're eating just sort of it naturally happens that you eat all the things that give you energy rather than eat things that take the energy way 
C:	yeah and if I don't do those things like if I have biscuits because I'm a pig really with biscuits and chocolate so I tend not to have them most of the time actually well I think it's both time but then what I do is fine I can hear myself saying or watching listen oh you should believe that bum doing 
T:	so much the Health Committee the Health Committee kicks in zone though so you find yourself doing things that aren't what you really want and when you are doing things that you don't really want you've got an internal voice telling you that you're doing this wrong
C:	yeah and sometimes 
T:	like everybody everybody does you know things that are wrong I mean what differences in range
C:	well there is some people seem to it's not really some people seem to have it crap that they can do and I've have periods of my life where I've had it crack that I just do what I do because it's all falls into place I 
T:	so you've been able to do this before you've been able to what eat healthily take exercise get into size -
C:	sorry honestly it well that's not in my in my Raider okay
T:	so okay you clear about that yep and so it won't feel good about yourself and you've managed that before 
C:	yeah I actually do that our Lily was born I was really fit and it was a pleasure it was a complete pleasure and you know I've had bounced of that since just like at the moment that comes to somewhere i'm going to those  that it doesn't really matter what size I'm innocence that's the right size for me it's just like ah
T:	sounds a bit one quite frustrating for you 
C:	yeah I'm frustrated with myself yeah and as I've said to you before I'm even bored with saying this i'm bored with myself yeah this is boring it's like instead of balkan back relaxed and confident 
T:	so you've relaxed and confident eating only the things that can give you energy refusing the things that aren't and then the voice I don't show you
C:	whatever I want enjoying whatever I do cheese okay alright so that's close 
T:	that just leaves me a little bit puzzled been really because you clearly you enjoy the biscuit 
C:	so you know what I at least it's a start and I can't tell you how quickly i had fun right I'd I think I didn't want my mom used to call posting them you know I don't know even hardly tasted them I just like one them in my mouth with a cup of tea and it's not that satisfying 
C:	really 
T:	very temporary very very very very quick 
T:	if you could shut up the voices that were saying now you shouldn't do this man and in there well then you didn't draw the biscuits with you so shutting up the voices is really what you need to do yeah do you know
C:	what I think I need bigger photo biscuits and that's for bit longer yeah yeah 
T:	so there's no free showcase they just done yeah obviously not suitable for you obviously not suitable for you so so I mean if you could get bigger biscuits if you could get biscuits that lasted a bit longer yeah and if you could shut the voices off job done 
C:	and keep up the physical exercise sign which I have done a lot of actually I've made want to take quite found changes this year I'm not all that visible but they are there I don't know deliver really which is good for 
T:	what exactly 
C:	they're just thinks it made a difference to my general house for the personal things really hope she turn into your  no but it probably will there's a lot of course straight stuff i needed to do which i've done and doing that's Wrecking I've got that absolutely crowd a big thing a physio I've got really good measurable feedback
T:	well that's not a very proactive then
C:	yeah that is very proactive 
T:	so so you can't happy without you actually taking some steps and done some things there around the road to this sort of this healthy person in a size and if I'm right and thinking is it's not just the  it's the health and feeling good about feeling good about this 
C:	is practical I've got about you know pairs of trousers at the size  why don't want to be uncomfortable in there when I can be comfortable in that could you sell them and get sixteenths with me no i don't to do like so they don't hang well my hips okay 
T:	well that sounds like you've barely determined to get this done so i suppose what still puzzles me is there you are really quite determined to to make some some good healthy giant lasting long are you really bored and sick to death of the internal diet committee going 
C:	my agent Lee why don't you get about it 
T:	yeah yeah so I don't know it sounds to me like you probably you probably you know the only half hearted about their sorry 
C:	that's the thing I I think I'm not half hearted but sometimes act like I'm half hearted so as I am I am it is important to me 
T:	how important?
C:	I think it's about that important 
T:	okay but that important 
C:	yeah I was just think that was that a measuring stick to be important important nine out of ten I guess 
T:	on a scale that yeah yeah okay so where are you at the moment if if they your success rate at the moment is?
C:	pretty shit is there well it's not actually because you've reminded me that the physio stuff has been coerced really good and that's that's been around a health issue so I now done with stuff with that 
T:	so answers was celebrating that success 
C:	yeah yeah it is actually yeah but you're still in this not really sure about the biscuits 
C:	it's not just a biscuit you know they're all committees well it's like I'm lying in bed this morning i'm thinking i'll do my half hour pilates you've got nice space in the in the little hole now we've moved the desk out okay i'll do that before work and now you are at work a little bit and again i have dialogue about that i'll do this tomorrow you know I'll swim I'll get swimming on Wednesday peas on my home nice aerobic exercise so in my timetable stay so I have the conversation about life as well you know what i will do some are a 
T:	I don't know that doesn't seem very serious to me really if you know it's like so yeah do it tomorrow nice do dresses what bullets
C:	that's exactly it is that I am serious and I'm not I'm not doing it 
T:	so what do you need to do to make that leap you know what what I don't know no i'm not sure i'm not really sure that you really are not motivated the biscuits and and they not bothering to exercise seems to be quite quite a nice thing for you too to counter play 
C:	short turn that's what I'm saying 
T:	and long term it's all in the story 
C:	about this the pressures over like that and 
T:	then they'd sugar ups and down to Italy and the fat stomach at the long-term effect so flat stomach for teens feeling good by itself and being healthy that's a long term so the short term how to subvert our Thursday yeah yeah and yet that you've still got these voices are telling you you sabotaging yourself 
C:	yes I suppose they're quite useful what was my I'd like shut them up as well or perhaps sure wonder if the voices could be useful mountain because just as I said that then I was thinking they're telling me I'm sabotage myself
T:	you ignore him 
C:	which is good isn't it because if I listen to them that's quite a good message to get if you just I never saw that before have you seen this pests
T:	so Tess boring press is the way you've seen them yeah and now what 
C:	I suppose the fact I'm know that I want to do this and that identifying that difference between the short and the long term 
T:	you really want to do this 
C:	yes I want to be doing it now 
T:	you really do
C:	yeah like so today i already am i've started today well they haven't have had biscuits of her things I mean it sounds so bloody trivial as they both it site
T:	which is trivial isn't it 
C:	well it's not
T:	just my computer okay just give me it's not true 
C:	no it's not true you're winning because it's not triple for a number of reasons but I think about it I'm just thinking about health I know that I've got I've got a chronic blood disorder which is not that serious it's just there but the effect it has on me is to diminish my energy sometimes so I know that those short-term sugar fixes for example an awkward for that from the research i've looked at they're just not good so it's not trivial actually
T:	okay so it's not true this is sabores out you are determined you didn't want to make the changes you not really sure now about whether those those boring purity Health Committee voices are useful or not useful 
C:	know so um don't worry sure I I forget how important it is you do okay and they tried to remind you so the so when I say to myself because obviously it's me I don't really have anybody else in my head so it's like it needs to be different message that I'm telling myself does it because you see I forget about this what's called you two pina stuff yeah until I remember about it 
T:	so they don't look so yes sir 
C:	so I don't think about that when I'm you know unplanned and grubbing what I can I get really hungry than I crumb fooding run and really I prefer savory food mostly 
T:	okay 
C:	I really do love chocolate and I'd like chocolates a treat you know to have some town and the KUSI's shut the fuck up for when I'm having chocolate so that I can just if I'm going to do it I want to enjoy it fully
T:	okay ah  C 	Dallas out then understand for myself all the time that for me you know with neutropenia and with just just me my lifestyle and what it is that actually looking after the physical me is just really important right 
T:	so those voices were saying that yes and they also cheered you on when you're eating chocolate hey yeah they're nothing don't don't what don't you sort of reinstall this determination to get healthy and fit in and fill good about yourself 
C:	yes and when I like today cuz you know it's a busy week away again us away from home most of us we can again all this week it's like what about the exercise 
T:	mmm 
C:	yes I think my mind and body are all connected yeah okay 
T:	so so good to have committee help you were there with the exercise 
C:	yes 
T:	I'm not I'm just hearing you saying that there's a resource that you could before you thought was a nuisance 
C:	the Health Committee could be really useful Health Trust except my own health trusts in you heard through my head 
T:	yeah yeah yeah ok that's just haha I'm really interested in what you intend to do what what you willing to do to you know to get what you really want yeah oh ok that's well
