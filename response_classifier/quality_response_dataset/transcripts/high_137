T:	hi Ashley my name is Noel and I am the social worker that is assigned to your case today how are you I'm doing 
C:	okay 
T:	um first to start the session off with I just want to touch on our confidentiality policy so that entails you I want you to be able to disclose everything that you can to me but I also AM supposed to inform you that if you disclose anything that could either harm you or is going to harm somebody else that I need to inform the proper authorities 
C:	okay 
T:	um and then I also just want to let you know if you see me taking notes or anything don't be worried it'll just um just sort of help me out stuff like that so um why do you think you're here today 
C:	um well basically I for the past couple years I've been stealing a lot of stuff like I'll go to like Walmart and Target and victoria secret and all these stores and I'll to steal a bunch is like clothing and like headphones and easy stuff to steal not necessarily the clothing because sometimes I have to rip the security tag off but i'll either stick in my bag or I'll like put it under my clothes and I'll walk out or whatever and basically my mom asked me the other day like why I have so much nice clothing and I don't really have a job or anything and basically she kind of figured it out and made me come here
T:	okay um so first of all first of all I want to commend you for coming in here today and taking that first step um so I want to start off with asking do you think that this is a problem for you 
C:	um I do kind of think it's a problem because I started off stealing like really little stuff like gum and candy and like magazines and stuff and now I'm kind of on to like the bigger stuff like the stuff that costs a lot more money so i think it is kind of a problem because it's gotten progressively worse okay so it definitely 
T:	sounds like you understand that the problem is progressing um well on a one to ten scale  being the most serious how serious have a problem do you think this is and you're like right now 
C:	I feel like it's like a  because my parents I think the reason I do it is because my parents don't really have a lot of money and they never really had a lot of money and I I still want to be cool and have like the latest fashion and hang out with my friends and and then not judge me for having not cool clothing and stuff and like the cool stuff so like I feel like it is a problem I need to address because it's getting I need to stop doing it since i'm almost out of high school 
T:	okay so um I can tell that you'd feel like because your parents don't have a lot that you kind of feel the need to steal in order to kind of keep up socially 
C:	um yeah okay 
T:	so what would have to happen for you to know that this is a problem or move higher up on the scale of how serious 
C:	i think the i think i would need to have to like get into serious legal trouble probably like arrested or or like a charge or something or like just something really scaring me because right now I feel like I'm like nothing that's going to happen to me because I do it all the time and I've been doing it for a long time 
T:	okay well it's it's definitely good that you grasp the possible consequences of jail time and things like that what do you think that the pros and cons of making this change our 
C:	um I think the pros are that I would probably stay out of trouble and the other pros would be like my family like my mom would be off my back my dad wouldn't be like embarrass I do it and the cons would probably mean that like my friends might not think on my school because I don't work will close and I think it might be kind of hard for me to stop because I've been doing it for so long 
T:	okay um so would it be safe to say that friends and family are definitely something that you value
C:	yeah 
T:	I lee in your life they're pretty hot 
C:	yeah 
T:	um so I think I'm seeing a little bit of a discrepancy between your behaviors and then I guess your relationship with like your family and friends do you feel like these behaviors affect your relationship with 
C:	definitely because my mom and dad have been like really on me about it and then like my friends don't know about it but i just feel like if i do like end up getting in trouble when i go to jail that like it's going to be even worse for me like socially because they weren't like wow she didn't steal and she went to jail for a long time for stealing when I could have just told him that I has happen money issues 
T:	yeah um well what do you think that you could do to overcome these barriers and make it easier for you to change these behaviors
C:	um I think that I could tell all my friends that like I am having him on each other when I've always had money trouble and if they don't understand if they don't understand and they're not my friends and I could if I ever felt like I needed to steal I could talk to like my mom or my dad or my sister my brother before I feel the urge to steal and then I guess lastly I could try to find a job
T:	yeah definitely those are a lot of good ideas um do you believe that changing these behaviors will be in your best interests 
C:	uh definitely because I really need to stop doing it because I'm I'm getting too old for it and I don't want to have to go to jail 
T:	um okay well it looks like we're almost out of time here so um just in between like now in our next session if you feel like you have any compulsions to to steal or anything like that um I want you to kind of focus on these goals and things that we thought about that you could do or like talk to your family members or even talk to your friends about Hannah being a support system and helping you to maybe avoid these feelings that you need to steal and then in our next session we'll talk more about smaller steps to get you going on your way but I think we made a lot of progress like this session and so yeah well that's a good place to stop and we'll pick up where we left off 
C:	all right thank you
