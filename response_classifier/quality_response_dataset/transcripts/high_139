T:	hi Chris I thanks for coming in today and filling out our survey I wondered if it's okay if I go over a couple of things that that you answered in the survey 
C:	yeah it's fine 
T:	okay one of the things that I noticed is that you are not using any kind of birth control right now 
C:	yeah 
T:	okay and I just wondered if we could talk for a few minutes about some ideas and and I wondered what what your thoughts are about using condoms
C:	well I've heard stuff about them that I don't really need them and they're not going to do much for me and just kind of hassle to go out and get them so okay I don't really use them for that reason
T:	you've heard a lot of negative things about condom usage okay so Chris it's okay if I share with you some of the things that I've learned about condom usage and some of the things that my clients that are around your age have shared with me about condom usage 
C:	yeah that's okay 
T:	what some people don't realize and don't know about condoms is that may not only prevent help prevent teen pregnancy but they can also prevent sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia along with HIV they're really effective in preventing these things and there's also a lot of easy ways to get condoms these days that some people don't know the local health departments have condoms and many times they're free and local pharmacies drug stores have condoms and there are a lot of clinics that have them as well either for a small fee or sometimes they're actually free and there's some some ways too that people have found carrying them around pretty convenient you know in their car or in their pocket because they're pretty small what does it sound like as I'm talking what are some thoughts that are going going through your mind 
C:	definitely changing my mind about condoms a little bit think there's no hurt and just carrying them with me and if they do protect against all that stuff that you said I mean that sounds a lot better than what I have heard I definitely want to avoid all those consequences 
T:	okay we're not interested in and coming a father right now I'm guessing 
C:	not yeah 
T:	okay great well can I ask you so after this conversation today on a scale of 0 to 10 with 0 being that it's not at all important to you and 10 being that it's extremely important where do you think you fall with how important you know taking a chance in using condoms with you now.
C:	after everything that you've told me it sounds pretty important to me we're like an eight or nine 
T:	okay okay well that's great it sounds like you really have you know a plan in mind what do you think you'll do next like what do you think would be a next step with you as far as contraception and condoms
C:	 probably go out and look for some condoms 
T:	okay we have an open mind to them okay well we've got some here at the clinic would you like me to give you some on your way out and you can just take them with you
C:	Yeah
T:	Great well thank you so much for talking to me it was nice to meet you
