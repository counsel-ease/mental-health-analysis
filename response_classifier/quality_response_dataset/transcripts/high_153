T:	well seen my wife's been getting on me a lot lately about trying to improve my health habits and I don't see what the big problem is 
T:	you've been working real hard 
C:	sometimes I can't come home for dinner so I'm having a lot of you a police or someone like that she seemed to have a problem or don't see the big deal 
T:	okay and so what I'm hearing is that you don't feel like your health is concerning to you right now and about that 
C:	I've definitely done my work is really manual labor intensive so I'm usually working it out and in Ostend the gorge of the day so he was sweating out any like bad things up in my system 
T:	so okay have you noticed putting on any weight a little bit but nothing too blue okay okay and how about hope to see his doctor have you gone to visit a bit of dark driving last year for physical but being everything showed up to be following that you feel good you feel good okay that's what I hear is that you you feel like your wife might be overreacting to this 
C:	well minato really over right no no no she was being a no-shoe 
T:	she wants for you to live a long time and be healthy but it's sometimes special you work hard 
C:	on when I kind of going out to eat these places kind of in a little bit better better situations
T:	sure sure okay um and so one thing I just like to do is maybe give you some information on baby obesity or diabetes that you're interested or open to that at your shirt
C:	so I guess the issue is that you know my doctor seems to think that my blood pressure was a little high but I really don't think that there's a problem and you know I eat really well and you know she suggested that I watch my caffeine but really caffeine is not a problem for me 
T:	okay but we were talking a little bit earlier earlier in our conversation you had said that you didn't feel like it was maybe causing some of your agitation so it's a little bit of
C:	I'm not sure 
T:	so where are we did did you do you feel like you do have some agitation on the coffee or is it just no problem at all
C:	well you know sometimes it makes me a little jittery and you don't have to go to the bathroom more frequently than some of my co-workers but and working in the hospital they don't really look so highly on a good bathroom frequently but you know it keeps me awake it keeps me aware it makes me more able to like you do my job better and so I really don't see that it's a real issue I mean maybe my blood pressure is a little high but yeah so let me see about half this 
T:	so you see you got some positives the awareness and if you feel kind of on your game and then there's some negatives with you know your coworkers that they don't you know that your boss may not want you you know check it out the hospital floor for yeah yeah and then the blood pressure thing is that sound about right 
C:	yeah yeah well you know and sometimes like I said it does kind of make me a little jittery and I'm not not use relax but you know I really like it and like I said it makes me more aware what's going on and I feel like I'm much more observant
T:	yeah how about frequency if you feel like you're good on how much coffee you're drinking 
C:	yeah about four cups a day
T:	okay that feels about right to you 
C:	yeah I mean I'd I mean the co-workers that work at night gosh they bring in a carafe
T:	yeah what would happen if you if you looked at maybe reducing that with that habit would that get rid of maybe some of the things that are problematic the number yeah yeah but you're training for a day you're probably have that morning cup
C:	I really you know I really like waking up and that whole ritual so I definitely don't want to get that up I gotcha okay so that was important yeah and then of course you know working a -hour shift I really think that you know the afternoon to keep me going until the evening is a really good idea too I can probably give up the mid-morning
T:	that's great yeah yeah I think so so you've identified one of the four that might you might be willing to to try for a while to let go of what do you what do you think of that sounds alright so you're sick of this 
C:	yeah I I can't shoplift anymore and I got I got cold again and you know I think I suspended got back to the school so I'm gonna mess up my whole life here unless I can stop this yeah it's bad my friends and I we just it's fun and so I don't know what to do but I gotta change my morning so it sounds like you're ready you're ready to give this up yeah but maybe the path to doing that isn't so clear right I don't know what I'm going to do I got some friends these guys are they're bad news but they're my friends and it's fun so you know nothing much else going on that's as fun as this doing we still we see these and was working at farm thanks for coming back in I know last time we talked about maybe going out and joining some activities in the community look I'm meeting some people 
T:	so then you could tell me about how that's going why didn't do anything yet 
C:	I didn't go I know I was going to go but I didn't but I did look at there's the YMCA they've got some classes that I think will being pretty cool to go to and then there's a yoga class over the Women's Center it's only like  bucks so I could do that but I can go to really afraid that like worth you know what human likes me more my friends 
T:	yeah I know you've mentioned that in the past when we were talking about the pros and cons of going out to one of these activities you really mentioned anxiety it's a big column 
C:	yeah but I'm gonna do it anyway because this is what I need to do to make to make friends hook up to make a change they have one for sometime

T:	so how last time we talked to you you were kind of cutting the ex-boyfriend now this is dealer so how's that going 
C:	all right it's been good I haven't answered the phone when he's called and a couple of my other friends have tried to call me as well and I haven't answered the phone so it's been good for me to just reach out like me a couple new people and neighborhoods I'm living in 
T:	so sounds like you made some good changes changing your environment and some your behaviors and these new friends
C:	yeah the new friends and I've been using the you know the breathing exercises you taught me when I get starting to feel a little stressed out I've been using those and it helps me I go for a walk and do my breathing exercises and it calms me down and kind of
