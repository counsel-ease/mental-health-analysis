T:	good afternoon Bruce I'm glad you could make it in today thanks for coming in here last week when you were an you had come in because you had had a positive urine analysis test for marijuana and so we were working on ways that you could cut down or extinguish marijuana use all together and how did you feel about our talk last week 
C:	I was okay I guess 
T:	yeah just okay yeah all right okay I want to refresh your memory at not godly notes here do you mind if I refer to my notes
C:	what's good
T:	oh we had developed for strategies to help you decrease the amount of marijuana if not cut it off altogether and one of the items were worlds were to run more you used to run a lot and you like to run and so we have realized that the marijuana use usage was merely a mask to self-medicate for the depression but we also know that running up serotonin and in many cases is just as good as an antidepressant so you're excited about this last week so I'm wondering how you made up with the running last week 
C:	well it was raining out so I didn't really get around to it it was pretty cold 
T:	so yeah yeah and so because of the rain and the coldness it kind of took away from your from your mood and your motivation to go running
C:	yeah I wasn't in the mood 
T:	I'm wondering what you could have done to get in the mood
C:	I'm not sure what I could have done and so because of the not exercising 
T:	did it make any difference in your marijuana usage this week 
C:	yeah with what i use a bit more 
T:	okay okay so how would you tie those two things together by not running
C:	I think that it makes what I'm not exercising that generally I would turn to the more usage 
T:	yeah yeah so when you reflect back now on last week and the rain coming down and it was cold I'm wondering if there's a way that you could change your perception about that such that it wouldn't stop you from running how do you think 
C:	yeah I could probably change the perception about that maybe we're a rain jacket or something 
T:	mm-hmm that would be a great idea that would be an excellent idea some people even think that it's fun running in the rain and the cold so that might that might absolutely be an alternative the other thing was to stay away from your friends that you would consider bad influences with using the marijuana how did you make out with that
C:	oh I tried to stay away but I didn't I still saw some of them 
T:	so it was it was difficult to cut them out of your life last week and can you tell me more but what was difficult about it 
C:	well I just thought that they think something badly of the only one time to think avoiding or AZ 
T:	so you didn't it sounds like you didn't want to hurt their feelings three by them thinking that you were going to avoid them 
C:	yeah 
T:	and so as a result of this what what happened
C:	oh well I just ended up going to see them yeah 
T:	and so because you were worried about them thinking that you were trying to avoid them you ended up using marijuana is that correct 
C:	yeah we did
T:	yeah and I'm wondering how you could do that differently this week 
C:	oh well I could I suppose I could just try or not to go in and see little guys and what would that involve trying hard or not to go see them hmm i guess it's as simple as just not going 
T:	yeah sometimes it is that simple is just making that commitment to yourself and just drawing the line and do you have any friends that do not use marijuana that you could kind of associate with 
C:	yes yeah I do I don't see that often but I could I could go see it start to see that more
T:	okay how motivated on a scale one to ten would you say you are too kind of reignite friendships with people with people that don't smoke pot 
C:	maybe a vote of three 
T:	okay so you're still you're still a little iffy about you what about whether you want to associate with those friends again but I have to ask you Bruce what gee what made you say three instead of one 
C:	well because i know i have pro so i feel like i need to i think i should start doing something about it I think 
T:	that's great insight that you're able to see that moving towards the friends that don't smoke pot and making the effort to do that is actually going to enhance your life incredibly and when you associated with the friends that didn't smoke pot in the past what kind of things did you do what was your life like 
C:	oh I like with what this kind of thing is activity is insane yeah was it fun being with them yeah it was fun yeah we just mostly like doing some activities maybe just sort of get some fresh air kind of thing usually it's a not so like you know there's more they tend to do more healthy activity
T:	that would say so you can recall living up healthier life than and having fun of doors and basically having the healthier life overall without using the pot 
C:	yeah I think I think that writer it could be a might take my mind off of it
T:	mm-hmm sometimes it's good to remember having those good times with the friends that didn't smoke the part because it makes you realize that you don't really need it and I think it's a great I think that's a great idea the other item on your goal whether it's a goal not an item was to get a pet how did you make out go and it was a dog you were going after a dog at the SPCA and how did you make out with that why was 
C:	I really had a lot of second thoughts about it and I was worried about commitment and and I kind of think so I didn't feel like that was the right idea
T:	mm-hmm okay so you had some second thoughts about that you are excited about it in last week's session but after a chance to reflect upon it you kind of realize that it wasn't getting a dog was not the best thing for you 
C:	well there's lark think there'd be a lot of commitment and a lot of time that I just don't have the motivation to to be put in I think that's why is to recognize that right up front I'm given the research on pets any kind of pet and how it helps people sustained from alcohol and drug usage 
T:	I'm wondering if there is another option that you might consider
C:	maybe maybe what what do you have in what I'm thinking do you like pets that are don't require such a commitment
T:	that's a good idea
C:	I didn't think we'll that because a dog is the talk is a large commitment 
T:	yeah there's all kinds of animals and snakes or fish or something okay snakes are fish that would definitely be a star these animals that you like 
C:	yeah 
T:	all right yeah I think it's important that you have an animal that you like and that you can relate to alright so in the final goal was to find and join a support group for people that were trying to be asked and then from marijuana how did you make out with that 
C:	well I looked into it but like I went to the first the first meeting and I just I felt like like those people were bought on the barrel and I was just not I just didn't fit in with that crowd just I'm not where they are that place
T:	so you made the effort to go and you went but that was 
C:	I couldn't I just didn't want it 
T:	and so we you didn't say the whole time and so you left early because you felt you didn't feel in you they were the bottom of the barrel and you're still higher functioning
C:	yeah yeah 
T:	I can definitely understand that I'm wondering if there is any purpose for you joining some sort of support group to help you what do you think
C:	yeah I can see there could be some positive I just don't I don't I just don't see it that much you at this point 
T:	mm-hmm and what might be some positives that you would get out of the support group
C:	why would I would probably be able to relate to people the same kind of situation oh maybe it's just a positive to be able to have connection with people 
T:	so you're you're saying that the positives of being in a support group would be that you'd get a chance to relate to other people who are on that same journey and do have connections with other people and again I can send you information that will show you that that just these two items alone are incredibly helpful for not only decreasing or being abstinent from pod but from increasing the feel-good hormones in your body the connection and the relating to other people it might be similar when you are younger you had mentioned last week that you were a hockey player and so you had support that was sort of like a the team was sort of like a support group I'm wondering if you could relate to people and had connections so I'm wondering if you could see a support group as a team
C:	yeah it would probably be the same kind of situation like essentially people in support group for all there for the same goal so it's kind of in hockey or embrace very with their win 
T:	mm-hmm and and do you remember when you were playing hockey how it felt to be encompassed in that team it's good it gave and that's because of those good feeling hormones that come and neurotransmitters that come throughout your body when you have those connections so how committed do you think you are if I were to send you a list of support group so you could try out some others where there weren't the bottom of the barrel as you say there how committed do you think that you would be trying out at least two of them this coming week 
C:	probably eight
T:	yeah wow what made you see an eighth rather than a  
C:	well just a team analogy i think is a good analogy 
T:	so you thought of how you remembered you remember how you felt when you were on the team and how it gave you that sense of connection 
C:	yeah and also you know i don't have to be the mean if if he said if I think of it as a team maybe I would be like a star on the team because I'm not quite so long barrel maybe 
T:	I love that analogy good thinking good thinking Bruce that's excellent Wow well just to summarize today you came then you had made some progress that you had some stumbling blocks um you have decided that whether it's rain or shine you're going to run anyway because you're going to have you raincoat and you're going to embrace more of your positive friends rather than the friends that are not such a good influence on you and getting a pet rather than getting a dog you're going to look into getting a snake or what was the other thing ovation okay and in terms of a support group I will send you a list of support groups and you feel that on a scale of one to ten that you're about an eight and actually caring through and drying up two of these support groups because of the hockey team analogy great job so overall how would you rate today's session 
C:	it was good very good 
T:	and if we were to put it on a scale again one to ten for debate 
C:	about  right 
T:	we did good that if we didn't eight glad you came in to Dave Bruce and I will see you next week and check up and we will we will see how you did with these goals and then we will move forward from there all right way to go 
C:	thanks all right you
