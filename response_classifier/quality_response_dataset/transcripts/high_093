T:	hi John nice to see you again so tell me how are things going 
C:	well doc I know you told me that I need to lose weight and even though the scale didn't show today I was able to lose about  pounds but then I gained it right back 
T:	well I appreciate you bringing your weight to the forefront do you mind if we explore this issue further 
C:	no by all means I know we have to discuss it all right 
T:	well it sounds like you've been struggling with your weight recently and I understand how difficult it is to lose the weight and then have to come back again so tell me what you did to lose that initial  pounds 
C:	I started watching what I ate I ate less I've been eating more fruits and vegetables I've also been walking I'm walking up to  minutes a day now I saw the way come slowly off and I felt better but then I watched it come back on again I gave up 
T:	but you did have some success tell me how you felt when you lost the weight 
C:	I felt great I felt really proud of myself I thought that this was something that I could do okay
T:	well it sounds like you realize that when you lost the weight you feel better and that it's going to affect your overall health so tell me what you think changed that caused you to gain the weight back well
C:	I think it's because I've been eating more fruits and vegetables that's it
T:	and how many servings are fruits and vegetables on average per day would you
C:	have to be honest I have four five forty six glass of orange juice a day I have fruit for lunch and breakfast I have usually one to two servings of a vegetable my close your broccoli with thinner 
T:	John is very important that you recognize that some fruits but especially fruit juice can contain a huge amount of calories did you know that a glass of orange juice has almost as many calories as a can of cola 
C:	no I didn't know umm but doesn't the food pyramid classify fruit juice as a serving 
T:	you're absolutely right but keep in mind that the food pyramid is to be used as a guideline only when it comes to nutrition we have to have a more personalized approach so I have a hunch and that is the excess fruit that you are consuming probably caused your weight rebound what's your impression 
C:	well this changes quite a bit I mean here I'm thinking that my fruit intake is making me healthier and actually it's making me fatter indeed
T:	let me ask you something knowing what you know now how important is it to to lose the weight by decreasing the amount of juice that you're currently taking 
C:	it obviously I need to cut back on the fruit juice but boy do I love that OJ oh
T:	I understand let me ask you this on a scale from zero to ten zero mean that there's no way you can do it and ten meaning that you're % confidence that you can do it how confident are you that you'll be able to reduce the amount of juice you're currently taking 
C:	in six or seven 
T:	all right so you're not a zero so that tells me that you've got some confidence that this is doable this is something you certainly can do why are you not a zero 
C:	I guess is because I know that I need to do it to lose the weight
T:	so you realize again that if you decrease the amount of juice you're taking in you're going to decrease your weight you're going to feel better and you're going to impact your health positively 
C:	yes 
T:	but you're also not a ten and that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success what would it take for you to be a ten or even an eight or nine 
C:	getting the fruit juice of the house because I know if it's there I'll drink it my wife does the shopping for us so maybe if I ask her not to get the juice that would solve it 
T:	okay now if the juice was still there can you think of anything else you could do I suppose I could replace it with low-calorie drink or drink more water excellent 
T:	John I get the impression that you want to stay in course with weight reduction and the best way to do this will be to decrease the amount of juice that you're currently taking in so if I saw you in two weeks and I asked you how much juice you're drinking and how you did it what would you tell me 
C:	I'd say I didn't have any and I substituted it with sugar free drinks 
T:	excellent well it sounds like you have a plan same scale zero to ten how confident are you that you can make this happen okay I agree all right well you know what I'm not going to start any medications today your labs were a little bit off but I think we can handle this from a purely lifestyle standpoint what do you think great sounds good to me excellent I'll see you in two weeks you
