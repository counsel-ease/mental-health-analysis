T:	this week it's really good to see you again how you feeling about where we talked about last week developed or maybe because some changes not do you or I kind of waking up p or need to change inside of you how's it going?
C:	well there's a lot going on with the court stuff that I got going on and you know looking at possible jail time and you know talking with my lawyer and with that you know it's just really stressful and it makes me want to drink again and i know i shouldn't but just you know all this stress with everything that's going on you know that's the only way I you know I if I could just have like you know maybe a glass of wine or something that might help me feel better and understand things but I also know that I was you know that's kind of what got me into this situation you know I was out with my friends and I had like eight glasses of wine and tried to drive home so I know that I shouldn't be doing it so I'm kind of you know I know the difference I know I should be going you know working out but it's still it's easier just to have a glass of wine and you know just try to think things out that way 
T:	so you're realizing all these things that are ramifications of the DUI are really positive stress wants or trigger you to drink but at the same time you really realize this is something you probably shouldn't do and that's ultimately important to you
C:	yes I you know I can since we talked the last time I can definitely see you know how my drinking has kind of led up to where I'm at now and you know that maybe there's different ways that I can deal with things instead of just wanting to have a drink 
T:	mm-hmm that's so good good insight and it sounds like you're still kind of on the fence um we do permission I'd like to ask if I could possibly use a tool that's worked pretty well for some other books it's called a decisional balance scale and it sort of helps you weigh out both sides of the issue so eun hye fellow a more comfortable and privacy explore reasons to change and what would happen if you didn't if you did change and then also reasons for not changing what what happened if you get that is that something with you willing to do today
C:	yeah I mean we can look at that I do it kind of in my head anyway so I'm getting it out on paper would give me a visual to kind of wrestling back to
T:	okay are you comfortable writing or would you prefer me to 
C:	I um I can write
T:	ok so let's start what about reasons to change what's going on 
C:	um reasons to change what we could be you know just spiritually and physically a healthier person 
T:	okay what does that mean
C:	when I'm drinking I don't feel like I want to go to church or you know connect with other people who don't drink so you know I kind of lost that ambition to you know want to be around people who aren't drinking so it would get me back into their social groups
T:	good so to open up your social atmosphere baby 
C:	yeah 
T:	that's more of a positive influence and something that's sort of you know makes you fit in but doesn't necessarily make you feel good about yourself 
C:	yes you know and I've lost that one less for five years 
T:	okay anything else do you like bad
C:	um I think I would be able to you know be a better role model for people if I was you know if I could change even my drinking I would be able to you know be making an inspiration to others 
T:	so that would be a positive okay you like to give back some of this experience 
C:	yeah just in that sense is that I've you know a lot of family members drinks so I think you know maybe if I quit or if I could you know where's the skills that maybe you know with that I could help other people my family 
T:	so maybe breaking the cycle of what's happened to you for 
C:	yeah yeah
T:	that would be a positive spoons of a very good husband and some reason it would be really truly meaningful to that spiritual side you mentioned before 
C:	yeah
T:	okay um anything else before we want to kind of what can happen if you do change know that that's a good that's a good cap solution okay so if you do these things what do you think is going to kind of an outcome just to kind of sum up we have said 
C:	I think I would um I would be a more of a leader than inspiration as in people 
T:	okay your family members maybe people in a you really want to be anything 
C:	yeah I do I mean I've seen other people you not to talk with you and you know other people have shown me how it would be or how fulfilling it would be if I you know inspire some change within myself and if i do that i would like to give back
T:	so your associate for fulfillment throughout this process 
C:	yeah some sort of you know learning experience something take away from what's happened 
T:	okay very good things anything else that you feel like maybe these things you'll do you mention kind of some legal stuff over here is there anything that you want to add about that here or is that not important 
C:	i think if i change I would get I would be out of the legal system you know I don't want to be on probation I don't want to be paying these fines if they take a lot for my schooling my work you know my my family life so being done with that legal aspect would be something that I would definitely look forward to 
T:	okay just being able to get back to your life of things that you know 
C:	yeah I run to you i don't know like work like family yeah because it's you know I've not a high-risk insurance I have to go do extra meetings and go the group panels and it's just you know this is all added so much more to my life guess it's not that you're not very excited about something no and but i do want to take it as a learning experience so I don't want it to have to do this again 
T:	okay so you want to get a learning experience out of it yes all right anything else you want to add this box or should we can review what you wrote 
C:	that's yeah that's reviewing okay I don't remember one already 
T:	so just to kind of sum up you talk first about reasons not to change is that's kind of where your abs and then we also talked about reasons to change in this kind of writing won't go that was like so you mentioned that you the reasons you might not want changes it doesn't make you feel better when you're stressed out to drink it relaxes you it makes me feel like you can handle things yes um they're also keeps your same social Farrah social sphere of people that you trust and that you enjoyed spending time with and it gives you a way to fit in with those people 
C:	yeah and that's you know it's where i'm at right now on this i feel and people i like to be around 
T:	and you're comfortable there
C:	yes 
T:	okay um the results of not changing your brought out for that if things were to keep going the same way they are that you might get in more legal trouble especially after you have more serious but on the flip side you'd also keep the fence and filling them up don't worry about trying to be that change in the waters 
C:	yeah ok I'm going to the next side that sounds right
T:	and you mentioned that if you did change that you would feel like you're more spiritually and physically healthier which meant having a more open social clear positive people to you 
C:	yeah 
T:	and then you would be a better inspiration to others and that you might break the cycles in the family issues the patent paths that you've sort of perpetuating right now yeah underneath you feel a little uncertain about your going forward and and then if you did those things that you would feel you more a leader and inspiration to people around you and not really meant to you've been example to others in searching with them fulfillment in this process here you'd also mention that you would get a legal system you know you would have fines be done with all that stuff and not have any of the added pressures that being in the legal system puts on you yes and then you really get a learning experience out of the situation you can really apply for other things in your life 
C:	I would I think I will you know once this is all over with you know hopefully I'll look back and be like that was something that I did and I did
T:	wonderful
