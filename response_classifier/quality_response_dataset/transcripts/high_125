T:	how are you today 
C:	um I'm okay I just want to like let you know that I know that I have to be here every day this week and I know that this is important but i think i'm going to get here because my car towed and my has a marshal time so i don't know how in the world i'm going to get here so i just want to let you know that up front 
T:	okay thank you thank you for that and first of all welcome to the Hope Center it kind of sounds like looking at your file that this isn't going to be a place where you can get the help that you need should you choose to come weekly so I understand getting your car impounded is a difficult situation thank you for letting me know that and would you like to tell me a little bit about how that occurred in fact why you're here 
C:	um well basically I was leaving a friend's house and I are pulled over for speeding and the officers no leave my car and so he calls come out and searched and I had a little weight my car so it got impounded I got arrested and i got charged with missing error from the session and place them a lot of  on probation so part of my probation and the others on here my husband is that i have to complete this program so that's why I'm here
T:	it's very difficult i'm sure for you be here first of all and second of all it sounds like a la has occurred so you were arrested after being stopped that can be difficult as well having a dog search your car that's very tough to deal with so we arrested you went to court it does sound like though the judge was kind of lenient that works out for you in fact i'm assuming that if you complete treatment that won't go on your criminal record so that's probably good at it also sounds like you're a little concerned about them now your husband might feel about this situation 
C:	yeah I mean he's trying to say now that this unfit parent because I got arrested and I mean I've never had my kids have never wanted for anything I've always I go to work every single day I paying the bills I'm there I cook dinner every night in my opinion I don't really feel like marijuana has ever stopped me from doing anything in our life yes I know it's illegal but I don't feel like it's a problem I don't feel like I'm this addict that he's trying to pin me fee you know I just make this all kind of crap honestly I don't have any other problems and I don't know if like me to be here
T:	I totally understand that and it sounds like now your husband just is watching you you have a judge watching you and you're on probation but it also sounds like you care about your family and sounds like in your mind and perhaps your vestments you're a great mother you provide for your children they're well fed their well cared for and this is the only probably been it before so I can see where you might not think that this is this is a problem for you
C:	I mean I don't think you know this is something that has never affected my life so I don't feel like you know I should have to go through a treatment facility what I don't believe to like have a problem understand 
T:	well let me ask you this would you mind telling me about maybe how much you smoke every day and what typical day with or without pot just left for you 
C:	well i mean i usually wake up in the morning and i get my kid tiger school and I send them off to school and then I smoke a bowl and I get ready for work and so I mean I'm not like super high when i get to work I just like knock the edge off in the morning it gets me motivated you know I go to work and I have a really high stress job you have an accountant I an S I have to sit by Manu Peter all day long like crunching numbers and if I don't do something when I would die if I have to sit in this cubicle all day so you know after work you know I come home and I take care of the kids I make sure that you know they're fed they're bathe you know we do story time they go to bed and then I spoke about quite a bit help me sleep but you know other than that I mean I'm a smoke with my friends on the weekends because that's what we do you know we don't drink alcohol I mean that's stupid we don't drink and drive from we just you know me and you know so cold and hang out and you know with each other and I mean that's just what we've done for years in the oven so that'sthat's  years old you know  now 
T:	so it sounds like wait is this in fact quite a large part of your life your social circles those folks that you hang out with they do that as well as part of your daily routine but it also sounds like you're responsible in that you have a very good job but it's also stressful it is normal for people to look for ways to destress when we come home every day and also to take the edge off as you said morning but it also sounds like you're still making sure you're taking care of your kids that they're fed before they go off to school sounds like there's a lot going on with weed and in your life let me ask you this do you remember a time when you before you were  or time as an adult even that you didn't smoke weed and what life was like for you then
C:	yeah when I first married my husband he didn't like it and you know I told him that it wasn't something that I was addicted to and so I'm stop me from watching and he basically said well why don't you stop now and I was like sure why not i'll stop so the first leg two years we were married I didn't smoke at all and then you know life happens me like almost lost her house he lost his job and I just got really stressed out and I just wanted to smoke and he understood because you know it was a really stressful time for both of us and he like didn't say anything about it and so for years now he hasn't said anything about it until now right 
T:	so it sounds like you're able to communicate with your husband about your your drug use and nice either understood that or not you decided as a couple that you would stop and and then you started back again so do you see now that may be there there might be an issue with with smoking 
C:	I mean obviously I mean I don't think so but I mean like I want my husband to you know be proud of me and I don't want to be here you know I think this is embarrassing to have to come treatment for so I mean yeah I understand there are you know consequences but you know I just don't I just don't think it's fair
T:	right if I can ask you or just let you know and I'm sure you know now there are certain risks when you when you use drugs see you might get caught and you mentioned it earlier that you don't drink and drive but do you see that do you see difference between being high and driving maybe on your way to work in the morning if you smoked a bowl and then perhaps having a couple drinks and drive it to work 
C:	I mean I feel like I'd refine when I smoke but I mean there have been times where you know I kind of days out when i was driving or and i didn't really remember where I was at and then I didn't it was by exit I was like oh wow I just like completely forgot  minutes of driving no so I mean yeah I think it I think it could be dangerous but I feel like I have a good tolerance like I feel like I could I feel like I'm
T:	okay right so what I've heard it before and what I'm hearing from renounced your where there is a risk and it's kind of impaired you driving at one point at the same time you probably enjoy smoking it allows you to take the edge off in distress and I understand that let me ask you this if you don't mind would you picture your husband here in the room with us and maybe tell me a little bit about what he would say about your smoking 
C:	we did this had in your life still he would tell me you girl out like you would tell me like you have two kids we have two kids we have this life like why do you have to have this thing in your life and and I mean I don't really have an answer for I mean I think it's just something I've always done and you know I don't really know what to do to really change something I've always done 
T:	right sounds like a difficult decision and one that perhaps you've made in the past with your husband is a couple because you probably chose that i'm guessing to make sure that you take care of your children it sounds like you're both very loving and responsible parents but there's this one small issue that perhaps as a recurring theme in your life and you enjoy it yet at the same time a thinker sounds like you're aware of the risks that are associated with that though
C:	yeah i mean i know their wrists and you know i don't want to lose my kids you know I don't want this ever to be something that you know my kids are involved in or you know I've been very careful to keep it away from them and I don't want something to happen and then to find something or to you know start using at  themselves I mean I don't think there's anything personally wrong with it as an adult now but you know I mean I could have used some guy that sat  telling me not to smoke weed well you know hey I would if I don't think there's anything wrong with in it but it would be nice to have had somebody to tell me like don't do that and I don't want my kids to be  you know smoking lead and they're getting it they're all
T:	right again it sounds like you're responsible and adolescence is a difficult time and if your children are coming toward that age if they were to see you smoking they could adopt that behavior as well but let me ask you what motivated you to make that change in the past when you and your husband discussed stopping smoking and tell me what that was like just to stop that have you might have done it 
C:	um I really had to find ways to like calm down because like I just would get really stressed out i mean i would come home and there's a lot going on um I don't know I think I just you know learn how to deal with my stress better and you know now I feel like you know i don't know if i could but i did before so i'm sure you know i could again 
T:	right that sounds like that you're you remember the time when you just stopped and what i heard is that you said you have you found ways to destress with it without the use of marijuana so it sounds like maybe you come you might be willing to make a change again at this point in your life 
C:	oh I think I could I mean I just don't want I don't want to be in this position again you know like I want to be with my kids I want to do with my husband I mean I do want to just you know make this go away and start afresh you know 
T:	what kind of start like this to be there anymore 
C:	so I mean I'm going to do like whatever it takes obvious that's why I'm here to be done with this so I mean yeah I think 
T:	so good it sounds like again what I'm hearing is that you are motivated by your children and by the situation perhaps you would like things to be a little smoother between yourself and your husband so think maybe fake down the road let me ask you this where where do you see yourself in a couple of years 
C:	yeah we talked about have another kid so we have their child we talked about my thing and you know I see myself what's another baby and moving or to Nashville we talked about there's some good job opportunities out there for him and I so that's kind of where I see ourselves right now 
T:	sounds like you have some Union husband both have goals for growing your family and tell me tell me what life would love be like as you picture it with two children and a newborn and smoking weed every day 
C:	well I don't think it'll be good I don't think it's something that you know I don't want to be like  year old something waiting you know I just want to find a way to deal with everything that's going on without having to you know explode good so I mean I don't think it's gonna fit my life anymore
T:	right well again it sounds like you kind of recognizing that it might be time for we to leave your life again so to speak that you have goals and then perhaps that could get in the way and then you don't see that as a part of your life you know in the future so what I'm hearing also is that there's some amazing opportunity for change here and that we can work on that in the future with you so that's how good 
C:	okay I'll try great thanks for coming to the hoax
T:	okay
T:	Oh Scott is semi sassy today welcome to the Hope Center for true my name is Miss Andrews and i'm here today to just kind of titled it our program and to kind of see why you're here today so for discuss warrior or our program so why don't you go ahead and tell me a little bit why are your name 
C:	well first of all i had to get a ride because i can't drive until they give me my license back it's going to be a couple of weeks so it's gonna be hard for me to get here for two weeks and kind of pissed off a little bit about it because i've never been arrested for anything in my life and I got a DUI a few weeks ago and it was my first I never had anything like that happen it's really embarrassing and a kind of pissed at work so but the judge diverted it or there's a diversion whatever however they do that but he said if I come and talk to somebody and get a little outpatient help then we'll go on my record 
T:	so it really sounds like you've had a very traumatic experience with this whole situation said you got arrested and then you had to go to court and everything was found a version 
C:	yeah traumatic let me tell you the back that police car smelled like vomit I don't know in there before I was it was nasty I've never been in a place like that before it is really really stuck but yeah so I've got the diversion thing going for me I've never done treatment except probably  years ago but anyway yeah I really don't see why need to be here at all of a problem with drinking or anything I just got unlucky I got caught everybody drives drunk I just got caught
T:	um I can definitely understand how you feel like they've been singled out you know in this whole situation they were watching you feel like they are watching yeah yeah important people agreeing with these good jobs that's not good what what job do you do tell me about your job 
C:	well I was the vice president of an aluminum siding company I know it's really excited but I was the VP so I have this big job right I drove everywhere people watch you and they see the man and said go to the bar after work and then they like wait for him to leave I'm have these small towns are they just look out for you but make really good money the problem is now they're a little embarrassed that this happened you know how about drink with the president of the company sometimes three or four nights a week nothing ever happens to him that happened to me so I don't know what's going on but they're a little embarrassed about this so I don't want to lose my job so that's also kind of why I'm here you know I figured what the heck I'll come talk to you 
T:	well it sounds like you really you know you really care about your job and you're very important what you do you know the vice president of this really really great company and you know you feel like this is something that other people do none of the people have company do and it just happens that you got caught this time does that kind of
C:	yeah that's right and you know I'm just a country boy that made a big so to speak you know I just happened to go to school and got lucky and it's not a great company selling aluminum siding is boring as hell let me just tell you there's three colors it's real simple right but you know my wife care about I care about her quite a bit and this is kind of hurt her a little bit too she's not too happy with me in fact I had to sleep out in the camper the other not that wasn't pretty so I'm just saying I willing to you know come here and do this because I want her to be happy with me and they've having lots of money to sell this graph to people so i won't keep doing 
T:	it so it sounds like you know you really you really have a reason that you really want to be here you care about your wife can you care about your job and you really like what you do is what I'm hearing right now you're good at it look 
C:	yeah I do like it as much as I joke about it's a good job of in the paychecks nice and the double was beautiful she loves that so I'm just saying you know I want to take care of her she cooks for me every night she takes care of our six kids um got a big family they're getting up in age now in high school they don't need to see this happening to their father 
T:	so that sounds like you you know you really care right kids in want them to see you you know in a situation like this in the future 
C:	yeah that's about right you could say that you know I'm not getting any younger and you know I've got it's sometimes it's hard if I drink a lot of night to wake up in the morning you know I'm usually on time for every day you know my father always said wake up and be on time for work I'm doing that but you know say it gets harder as you get over to wake up after you've been drinking at night you have a really good nice and it sounds like you really you know probably on being a good worker and getting there on time and you know it can be hard 
T:	from what I'm hearing that to be getting up now that maybe you know your drinking has gotten a little bit more as you got older 
C:	well you know the job it's stressful it's stressful and all the kids and I'm going to pay all this money for all these kids in football uniforms cheerleading outfits and cars all that junk you know but I don't want anybody to tell me quit drinking I shouldn't have to that's not you know it's no I shouldn't have to quit completely at all I can still hold my liquor don't get me wrong i understand i mean 
T:	it seems like you know you feel like you're good dad and you're trying to provide for your kids and it sounds like you do a great job and you know stressful to have six children and you know to provide for them and be a vice president of a company i mean that's it's a lot to deal with so I mean I can understand that you know you feel like you should be able to do these things and and enjoy them and it sounds like you know you don't really know why you're here and you don't really feel like you need to be here
C:	well just the judge said needed to the wife's little angry and you know but the main thing really I don't want to mess my life up I want to keep the job in those kids get my groceries and that's expensive so I got to keep making money and I'm going to be able to get another job like this one again 
T:	I can definitely understand where they're coming from you want to make sure that you have a job and a livelihood for your family and it sounds like you're your wife and your kids are very important to you and that is that for the reason why you're here 
C:	yeah that is then you know I guess I don't give me hey younger in the doctor said he said then he told me to cut back a little bit I didn't tell me exactly how much I drank but he tested my livery he said you've got this liver enzyme it's a little elevated and it's probably because of that well I'll cut back a little bit but you know I can't stop completely but yeah basically want to keep my job and I don't want to kick off early you know I'd like to live a little longer enough to march football an escort at lunch on this world 
T:	so you have you've got you've got some health reports back and the doctor said that you had some elevated liver enzymes and so he's to be making a recommendation it's for you yeah we have quit drinking I said hell no it's not going to happen I want to quit completely he said that but you better cut back he said somebody here in should drink anything more than two glasses of whatever a night so he said cut back a little bit but that won't be a problem what I did hear you say that I thought was really great was that you said that you want to sit around for a while but you're not ready to kick the bucket that you do want to think about your health from that you do want to be here 
C:	yeah that's true I'd be one of them a little longer there's a lot of things I want to do and take some trips with old lady and you know see the kids graduate from college that's important I think 
T:	that's great i think that you know you you have a lot of really great goals what would your wife if I had your wife in your children here what would they say about your drinking
C:	well they probably 
T:	well in life but I'm going to come home a little early to be there on kids come on you know after school and if you go out every night with people from work then you don't get home till eight or nine o'clock at night when you get there well you typically go to bed go sleep early so they want to see me a little bit more and then of course this whole thing about going to jail 
C:	well that just one pretty she's got a lot of friends and I think of friends or they're not making fun of the situation but they're just you know it's embarrassing for dive have to tell her friends and she plays cards with her those get hurt done and everything that oh so that's a little difficult for it sounds like you know 
T:	you don't really want her to have to experience some of this embarrassin no she don't need to go through this ever p.m. 
C:	that's you know that's that's important to me I love her to death nobody should have to deal with that kind of embarrassment 
T:	so do you feel like you are able at this time to maybe think about you know not drinking
C:	well as possible rimini on drank on La Feria off and on but nothing to wear was a problem but you know I went for the family I could probably look into that
T:	Scotty you can really see yourself in the next five years where does alcohol fit in your life at this time 
C:	well I don't know I think things would be a little bit better if if I did give it up I stayed at home you know my wife and I get along really well she's sweet where I enjoy your company so I would like to spend more time on my third take more trips and things so but if you know I don't have a driver's license or a car or job I can't do any of that so it's probably something I would think about just you know I'll drinking at all 
T:	you make some very very good points you know if you don't have a driver's license and you don't have these things than you know it's you're not going to able to do the things that you want to do so it you know it sounds to me like you have some things you know that are very important and some reasons and some people enjoy life who could really benefit from you making a change 
C:	yeah i'm told that a liver is expensive if I need another one so i probably should be good to the one about god that's probably the chain I'll keep me alive quit drinkin and plus I love southern sweet tea so I can switch to that if I need to but I don't want to too soon yeah I think 
T:	that sounds great I mean you know they have some flavor tea center delicious set up their format balls 
C:	yeah 
T:	well thank you so much for coming in today and I hope that we can we can help out yeah be back next week 
C:	all right
