T:	Hi Mrs. Smith your exam is normal except for that lack of energy that you complained about will be joined some tests to look at your thyroid and I'll call you with the results about that
C:	okay 
T:	I noticed that you filled out one of our drug questionnaires may I take a look at it? okay so just to verify what you said on here it looks like you do not drink alcohol and you do use drugs other than those required for medical reasons just marijuana 
T:	marijuana and other drugs new street drugs?
C:	no 
T:	what about medications for pain other than what or prescribed?
C:	no sedatives no simulants now 
T:	okay how often you use marijuana?
C:	um about five times a week
T:	five times a week yeah okay you know I wanted to show you on this chart here that using marijuana thought times a week the way you are and from what you said on our questionnaire put you in this category of being at risk 
C:	oh really
T:	yeah that needs to chew at risk for some health issues just like smoking cigarettes marijuana smoking can be harmful to your lungs and other parts of your body and I'd really recommend that you stop using marijuana okay you know that lack of energy that you talked about it could be that it's related to your use of marijuana and you are aware that marijuana is illegal 
C:	yes 
T:	and you mentioned on your form that you feel guilty sometimes and I'm wondering if perhaps giving up that marijuana maybe that feeling of guilt would go away I know you you have a daughter 
C:	and I'm not using around her and using something
T:	that's illegal perhaps would make that guilt feeling go away 
C:	I really don't know what to think about this, thank you
