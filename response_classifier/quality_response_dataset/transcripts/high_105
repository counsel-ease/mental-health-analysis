T:	hi my name is Ashley and I'm with counseling services here at UT um let's start by having you tell me a little bit about yourself and what brings you in to see me today 
C:	maybe you can tell me okay here goes my name is Hillary and I'm a freshman here at UT my parents live in Ohio that's where i'm from originally cleveland ohio i'm here at UT for the veteran a program i heard was pretty good passionate about animals it's what I want to do so I decided to go here I won't really know why my parents are making me come talk to you I guess I think I have an anxiety problem or something whole thing is actually pretty stupid if you ask me  
T:	well I've heard ohio  is a pretty nice place to live and the veterinary program is great here at UT um tell me a little bit more about why your parents think you should come to counseling 
C:	all right fine my parents told me that if I didn't go see a counselor than they wouldn't pay my tuition anymore and I don't work while I'm in school and i would say tuition is astronomical but i guess they might be kind of worried because i haven't met a lot of people here in Tennessee I don't know it's just so different from Ohio I had a lot of friends back home I was even homecoming queen in high school and I don't know things are just so different I've been having trouble making friends so I guess I've just been throwing myself more into my school work and I mean I really do get anxious sometimes about school sometimes I feel like I've changed employees but it doesn't everyone  
T:	wow what a big transition for you to move from Ohio to Tennessee takes a really strong person to be able to do that so I hear that you're kind of lonely hearing to this II and things are really different from back home so you're too been trying to keep yourself busy with school school work and sometimes you get overwhelmed
C:	yeah my parents told me that I've been having anxiety attacks what do they know I mean they're not even here I guess they could be right I don't know I feel like I just don't have time for this I really need to be studying  
T:	okay I hear what you're saying that your studies are really important to you let's try to focus on why we're here today tell me more about feeling overwhelmed with school 
C:	well there's just so much work I'm taking  hours I heard they have any time to do it or anything that I even want to do I really just want to do well in school but not my parents are riding me about this counseling thing it's just way too much I don't think that i exactly need counseling but I guess I'm here so here I am okay  
T:	so it sounds like you have a large workload and you already have a lot on your plate and now your parents are nagging you about going to counseling 
C:	yeah that sounds pretty overwhelming and I don't know I mean I had a big course load in high school I took AP classes I play two sports after school softball and basketball I was in several clubs and on committees and I was a little stressed out then but I didn't get worked up then like I do now I feel like I was much better able to manage stress then not like now  
T:	okay see so you had a lot of commitments in high school you did get stressed out but that was a little different it was a lower level stress compared to how you're feeling now it sounds like you had control over your stress level that time what did you do differently in high school to help you alleviate this stress 
C:	nothing I guess but I had a lot of friends at the time we're all going through the same thing and I guess I felt like I've always had someone to talk to other than my parents you know we would always go to dinner or hang out together after school we were go shopping even if we didn't have money I felt like they really really cared about me I felt it felt so good to vent people who really knew what was going on but then we all went to different colleges and we all just kind of lost touch  
T:	okay so it sounds like you felt like you had a lot of people that you could turn to at that time and now you can exactly turn to them like you once did because you decided to go off to different schools 
C:	yeah I really did and my friends back home really helped me through a lot of tough times  
T:	it sounds like it so what do you think it would be like here at UT if you would continue to go to counseling and we're eventually able to feel less overwhelmed than how you feel now about your course load 
C:	I mean I guess that would be okay actually it would be really nice to not feel so stressed all the time I hate it when i get so stressed that i can't breathe it's really scary I just can't catch my breath but I don't know I really don't have time for this I have so much homework I need to get done every day I mean I'm taking  hours it's a lot  
T:	okay so on one hand you feel like it would be a relief to be less stressed and overwhelmed about your schoolwork and then on the other hand you feel like you just don't have time to go to counseling because you have so much work to do 
C:	yeah exactly I feel kind of like it's a double-edged sword 
T:	and um what worries you about the anxiety you've been feeling lately 
C:	hmm I guess it would be really tough to get through school if I was so stressed out all the time like this but I do think I would be able to get through it I'm a really good student but I don't know I just wish I could figure out how to manage my stress well just like I did in high school  
T:	okay so you're really devoted to your studies and you think that you could be able to get through it but you're hoping to find some new techniques to help you manage your stress while you're here at UT 
C:	yeah I guess that's why my parents want me to see a counselor to kind of help me figure out how to become less stressed I don't know I feel like my parents just won't get off my back about the counseling thing you need to talk to a professional about how you feel over and over every time to talk on the phone it's like a broken record honestly I just think that they are trying to control me just like they did in high school always telling you do your homework get good grades stand up straight stop texting at the dinner table oh it was exhausting I haven't met anyone here that gets me  
T:	so it sounds like your parents have been voicing a lot of concern about you lately and they really care about what's going on with you and it makes you feel like you did when you live with them in high school and it's hard because you can't find anybody here that you can fit two 
C:	yeah I mean I guess you could say it like that they do really care about me and I have made a few acquaintances in my classes but the other day one of them told me that I get more stressed out than I shebin like where does he get off telling you that I don't know being here without my real friends makes me feel like no one is really paying attention to me  
T:	okay so you feel like you don't have a single person here in Knoxville that cares about you 
C:	well no I mean the people I met in class did seem concerned about me I just don't feel quite as close to them as I did to my friends back up I could talk to my friends about coming about anything I mean anything they were always there no matter what  
T:	okay um so you do feel like there are a few people here and not spill that are concerned about you um let's do some activities that I like to do with some of my clients um and then we can talk about them I like to call this first activity the confidence ruler okay so go there's just a little scale on there and on a scale from one to ten can you show me how confident you are that you will eventually be able to manage your stress and figure how to manage it better okay I fancy so you pointed to his six um can you tell me a little bit about why you pointed to a six why not a zero 
C:	well I don't know i was able to figure out how to cope with a busy schedule while i was in high school why can't you do it now I was just able I was able to do it then I'm sure I could do it now even though i do think that i'm just unsure i don't have the same social outlet that i had my doubts back home going through stressful situations and the work is just so much harder here in college  hours is a lot 
T:	okay I hear you so on one hand you feel confident that you're able to manage this home course load and the stress level and on the other hand you're unsure because you don't have the same social support it's like you did back home 
C:	yeah I would say that I feel like I might be able to I would like to think I could I don't know the course load is just so big and things are so different here than they were back home  I see so you're a little torn well let's do this I like to call this a self-care assessment it helps me get a better idea of where my clients personal values are um so just take a moment to look over that and fill it out would you like something to drink i'm going to go get some water myself no thanks okay I'll be right back um so let me know in your finish ok  i'm right um let's see what we have so it seems like a social life and education are very important to you um you also rated family and physical self care pretty highly um tell me about that
C:	well I've always really liked right staying in shape I used to run all the time back home I even did half marathon it really helped me clear my head sometimes it always stayed focused in school um I just haven't had much time here to do that if any at all plus I really don't know the area that well it's a new city even a new state and I'm always getting these crazy emails from UT saying people are getting stabbed all the time I guess I'm just kind of scared to go out  
T:	so you're a little out of your comfort running zone so to say you don't feel as comfortable running here as you did back at home with your friends yeah I would say so okay um tell me more about your family rating on that assessment 
C:	my family well of course I love them they're huge part of my life I mean they're my family I just I don't know I'm actually kind of mad at them for making me go through all this counseling stuff I'm in college now and they're not here I should know what's best haha and now they hold this tuition thing over my head they know I can't afford the tuition here so i just feel kind of forced I mean maybe I could pay for my tuition on my own I mean what should i do what would you do  
T:	well that's a pretty tough decision and um well I really think that you have the personal capabilities to come to that decision on your own I can tell from talking to you that you're a point in your life where you can make big decisions like that on your own 
C:	yeah you're probably right you could say that I really feel like I have ensured since being here at UT okay um so you feel like you've done a lot of growing up 
T:	yeah so it seems like we've uncovered a lot of ground today I feel like I have a better sense of who you are where you come from and how do you feel about coming back to talk to me well I still really like that my parents are making me do this but I guess it would keep them off my back for a while and who knows maybe it'll help I feel like you'll be able to find your fit here at UT I really do and I look forward to our next session
