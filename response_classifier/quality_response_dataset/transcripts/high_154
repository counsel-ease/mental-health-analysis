T:	wanted to talk to you um you know you're one of our star athletes really value you as a team player as athletic director one of my job's is to kind of keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best and something came up this weekend I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there and so I went to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now okay
C:	Oh actually could i confide something in you that has been bothering me lately well prior to that party like as you know I'm an honor student and my parents are like they keep me very like it kept down out of the lake so like social life and I all about a month ago my friends invited me to a party and I used the fact that all I'm always doing my homework am always studying that to allow me to go to the party and um well that party I managed to convince my parents that I would spend the night at my friend's house so I that's when I started drinking it was was a unique experience as you could say I guess you can say and I don't know I was fun at least in the moment so I kept doing it then this past weekend instead of studying for an exam I asked my begged my mom to let me go to another party and she kind of knew what I was doing she asked me too late to promise her no alcohol no drugs men i'll pick you up by  and i was surprised twelve was told us basically when the party starts but I told her whatever I thought I thought to myself that I'll come help figure out to delay her call me premium later so later so she promised she dropped me off I promised her no alcohol no nothing so we go I have fun like I've been having and I was drinking and then the time the time came for her to pick me up and as soon I couldn't delay her for pick me up and as soon as she picked me up and I step in the car she said you drank vodka and I'm like I didn't know what to say I just looked at the floor and I feel terrible because I betrayed my mother I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol and 
T:	that's exactly what I did so here you are you're an honor student your star athlete you've kind of been doing everything you've been told for all these years and maybe last month some time you started getting more involved in the party scene and it was fun at first but now you're already noticing some consequence 
C:	right like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards school work I haven't really I kind of just sit in class like my mind is elsewhere especially on the weekends we're instead about instead of studying i'm caught up with my friends trying to find what we can i get alcohol based on their age 
T:	and stuff like that it's really changed your focus
C:	yeah 
T:	what do you like about drinking 
C:	I don't know it it's I'm a very reserved person for the most part not well not when I'm doing sports but like in like a social environment I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious I would say and when I drink I feel I don't know like it relaxes me I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily in our way just so helps you kind of produce to not feel more relaxed exactly 
T:	sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though mom got mad at you you're having decreased focus you're kind of not doing so well in school maybe China any other things just different group of friends of group of girlfriends thank you different people than hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of so that's that that's also changed so your your friends that you were hanging out with there's a little tension there now a little bit because not all of them are into that 
C:	so like I'm in one group of friends and I would talk to another person that's in another group of friends and they just happened to invite me to that first party so since then I've been hanging out more with them getting to know them but I could also see that oh I'm just living life I guess but that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as it was before 
T:	okay as they are there for me well given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships affecting your studying it's affecting your relationship with your mom right where do you think you should kind of go from here 
C:	oh I feel I should just stop I mean like I'm not not unrealistic I understand that situations like this will happen 
T:	mm-hmm 
C:	it's just up to me not to take it so far where I can't remember the night before or if I'm puking all I remember is the toilet that's that's not worth it either and I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow as little I guess may seem to other people I created 
T:	it it's a big thing your mom is really important to you of course and how she feels about you is important how important is it to you to make an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit a lot 
C:	at this point because I feel that's a big factor with gaining back my trust with my mother and also getting back on top of my school work again my athletics too I feel that there's a feature in that 
T:	how confident are you that you could actually change or you're drinking or even cut down or quit 
C:	I'm pretty confident especially 
T:	on a scale of one to ten where one is not at all antennas completely what number
C:	probably like an  and I can't be a ton just nothing's a  in life I feel like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to 
T:	why'd you say eight or nine rather than six or seven
C:	because I don't know I feel to turn to determine to to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after i betray my mother I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting it's not a pleasant experience that it's not something that I wish to enjoy so I even if I do drink I don't want to drink to the point where that happens like all the fun that I have then prior to that it's not worth it's not worth drinking 
T:	all right what do you think is a realistic goal for you then
C:	to make sure i have my studies well first try to get get back my trust with my mother then just focus on my studies then if i have time i have read your time like oh i'll go party with my friends and just be as I party but that doesn't mean I have to drink and I do  cup is not gonna do anything to my life either but I'd prefer not to do that 
T:	I prefer just make sure your goal is kind of to not drink at all or if you are at a party a maximum of one at the very most exact Lee just so I take part with the social convention but it's not hey guys drop doing though yeah Chris they really appreciate you talking with me about this I know it seems like something that's been on your mind as it is and you know like I said I really care about you as a student and an athlete and want what's best for you so I'm glad we were able to talk about this it really seems like you have a good plan going forward you know really striving for not drinking alcohol at all and if you find yourself in a situation where there is alcohol making sure to have that limit of one drink maximum
C:	sounds like something that'll work for you and thank you for listening listening to me my Lots me 
T:	yeah it's my pleasure as part of my job as part I like best so I better hurry up and get changed for practice
