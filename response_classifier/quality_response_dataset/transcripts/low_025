T:	so Tommy I wanted to talk to you because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures that are kind of concerning to me of you and some of your friends at a party and you know you're such a good kid like I don't know what you're doing drinking it's gonna ruin your life
C:	I mean it was just the like a social gathering it wasn't like I was looking for it the drinks were there and I ate all my friends were doing it and it was just it's it's not something that I like do it Kate on occasion but whenever the opportunity presents itself it it's nice to just let loose and have a little bit of fun sometimes
T:	Tommy there's so many consequences with drinking you know you're not even 21 yet you could get arrested you could you know have a drunk driving accident you could you know mess up your schoolwork you have such a bright future ahead of you it just really really concerns me
C:	right I get what you're coming from but I I really did I thought that I had it under control and I didn't let myself get too far gone I didn't want to be you know how do I put this like I wanted to be in control and I wanted to make sure that all my friends were okay so I didn't let myself drink too much
T:	there's really no such thing as not drinking too much I mean anything that's drinking when you're underage is drinking too much you know like think about it think about all the things that can happen to you
T:	yeah I understand exactly what you're saying and
C:	how much are you drinking I don't think I'm drinking that much I mean it's it's mainly for social gatherings like it's nothing that I do like by myself or whatever it's just that either
T:	like every weekend
C:	every other weekend I would say
T:	Tommy I'm just so concerned you know can't you think of anything better to do
C:	I guess I can I can probably be more productive in my schoolwork and rather than going out to parties as much and I do get where you're coming from and is
T:	are your friends the problem like maybe you should just start hanging out with more kids in the youth group and not hang out with those kids that you're partying with
C:	yeah I guess I haven't really put it on myself I guess it's really been forced on their account and I've just been following in their footsteps just to just because it seems like what they're doing is a lot of fun and I just want to make sure that I'm getting every bit of the high school experience that I can
T:	well there's a lot of things that seem fun in the moment that we know aren't a good choice right that's some of the things we talk about all the time is making good choices for our life and really doing what's best for you and I just you know I really think you should think about making a big change here
C:	yeah I I do see that maybe me drinking not as much would possibly better my life to to a certain degree and I it does make a lot of sense and I I guess I can put more effort into sort of lowering the level drinking
T:	I think you really need to quit
C:	yeah I mean alcohol is just so prevalent in our society and it's just around me wherever I go and parties and stuff that I I kind of feel like I should just get used to it or at least understand its its effects before I should let it get out of my life entirely I don't I don't really see it as something that will completely destroy my life
T:	I think you're wrong you know it really worries me anyway I wish you would quit if all you're gonna do is cut down that's better than nothing you know I appreciate you talking to me about this but I'm gonna keep talking to you about it it's really important
C:	yeah I I just I don't see the problem in it right now and maybe it's because I haven't really had that traumatic of an experience but um
C:	do you want to wait for that to happen do you want to wait for a dramatic experience
T:	yeah you're right I don't want I don't want to be too far gone before it's too late like I I can imagine something possibly happening where it's to a degree where I can't escape and I I guess I've never really had any any real experience where alcohol has really affected me that much or affected anybody close to me that much so I guess it's something that I feel like I'm in control of but in reality I might not have as much control as I think
C:	all right well maybe it's something we can work on together and you know I think we should come up with a plan that's gonna work for you so that you can get control here and stop drinking
T:	yeah I think that that would be a good step forward into an a life of possibly being sober and just experiencing the true the true aspects of life rather than the the haziness of alcohol
C:	okay sounds good
