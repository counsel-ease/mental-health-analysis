T:	look Carl how are you doing today
C:	oh good good area I'm doing well thanks for asking last week you were talking in therapy
T:	yeah I mean and I thought a lot more about it this week after I mentioned it last week but a joke I was telling you about Jill my coworker and you know she was kind of bothering me in the past couple weeks but really this this past week was like the worst right so she's not doing her paperwork and the thing is is that she has to do these reports in order for me to do my reports so if she doesn't have hers I can't do mine and then I can't get mine out in time for the next person to do their it's a mess the whole thing's a mess and it's just it's annoying me
C:	so her work slowdown would not be efficient work is affecting your work productivity
T:	yeah yeah it definitely is and it it's one of those things that like you know has it gives me a bad a bad evaluation you know like it if I'm not eating my stuff in in time then it reflects negatively on me you know and it's it's all kind of she's she's the first level you know and then all the other levels are kind of dependent on her turning things in on time so she doesn't then I don't then the next person and so forth
C:	and it makes it seem like you're not doing your job
T:	right yeah and my boss doesn't like it my boss's boss doesn't like it so forth you know and I try to explain to them you know she's the problem but it doesn't always I don't always have the time to go up and tell them like here's what's happening or it just somehow it doesn't come out
C:	you don't always get the opportunity to tell people that are important at your work about the situation
T:	yeah and that's pretty annoying too because you know it's one thing if people get mad at me but then I'm able to tell them why I'm not doing my job like I'm supposed to but it's another thing for them to get me into me not realizing my fault you know
C:	you have an explanation for why the works that get done
T:	yeah I did I do that's the thing but I can't always get it out you know I can't always tell the person that's has the complain about and yeah I mean I tried talking to my my boss and I tried talking other people too you know but really hasn't gotten anywhere
C:	so you're feeling stuck with this whole thing
T:	yeah yeah I mean I talked to Jill a little bit about it too you know and I tried to ask I tried kind of gently reminding her you know like such-and-such needs to be turned in by Tuesday at 12 o'clock yeah I didn't want to be real abrasive you know but I I tried to remind
C:	it was a polite approach
T:	yeah yeah and it didn't didn't really seem to work because it's still happening
C:	your attempt to fix the problem hasn't really worked the way you wanted
T:	no it really hasn't and and that's just I feel like I've tried everything that I could try you know and even like I came home and I was talking to a friend about it and I was trying to think of other solutions right you know I was trying to think like what else I could do what else I could say who else I could talk to things like that you know and I mean my friend you know he was listening in staffing had some good suggestions but it he didn't know what to do either like cuz he doesn't know the way the company so like I got nothing
C:	you're not getting help you need for this
T:	yeah not at all feeling pretty lost with it and then I wish it was just like a clearer way to do things like this is what you should do now and I don't see anything
C:	some sort of clear plan
T:	yeah yeah but I yeah I don't I don't see a way to go about it I mean I so I right so this is the way I lay down my mind I tried talking to the people above me mm-hmm didn't work out the way I thought it would I tried talking to the people below me so to speak just lower on the before me in the process that's what I mean and that didn't work out which it's just Jill and I talked to her and that didn't work so like there's nowhere else I could turn
C:	the options are exhausted
T:	yeah that's what it seems like to me
C:	and this is frustrating for you yeah it is and I've been trying to Rack my brain you know like what else could I do you know like maybe if I could maybe if there was like a committee or something that I could go to you know and be like well this person's not doing what they're supposed to be different but there's not a committee like that or even if there was like a person you know like a resolution person or whatever but there's there's nobody like that
T:	there's no other Avenue
C:	that's what it seems like to me yeah and you knows I'm even trying to think like I don't know should I write a letter to somebody maybe but I don't even know who or what
T:	you've thought about a letter but who would you send it to
C:	yeah or like just something else that I could I can do instead of going to this person though that person that didn't work could I could I call us somebody is there anybody else in the company that you know might handle stuff like that but I mean there's there's HR people but that's I I can't really see where they could come in I don't know how Human Resources could deal with something like that
T:	you don't view them as a potential solution
C:	wonder me if there's like a but there's I mean I'm thinking now that there's got to be something or somebody or somewhere that I could put in like almost like a complaint or something like something's out of my hands and I don't know what to do about it look there's got to be something and now that I'm saying this I'm thinking that there's got to be
T:	some other resource you haven't tried yet
C:	yeah yeah and I mean now I'm trying to think back to my training you know initially you know what I think now that I'm now that I'm thinking a little bit harder about it a little bit differently about it I'm thinking that there's like man I forget what they call it now but maybe like a complaint but it's not the right word but maybe a complaint box or like suggestions or something and I think if I remember correctly those suggestions and those complaints get brought up at every staff meeting which we have like every other week
T:	they're discussed at this regular meeting
C:	yeah and I'm I'm thinking now I mean nobody really uses it but I'm thinking like maybe that's an avenue that I can use you know and like maybe that'll get brought up and maybe that's something that then might actually work
T:	this could be another option for you
C:	yeah it could be and then if it does work it'll get thrown and rather if they do read it it'll get brought up at the staff meeting where everybody's at my boss my boss's boss Jill everybody's there and maybe that's a way for it to come to everybody's attention that deadlines being missed affect other people in ways that you don't really know about
T:	so everyone will hear your complaint and maybe react in a way to help you
C:	maybe yeah I think that's I mean that's gotta be the way to do it and maybe that's the best way ever I really think yeah I mean after saying all that after going through that I really think that that's probably the best way to do it and if it if it doesn't and I guess I could find another way but I really think that's the best way to do it
T:	you feel as though you found an option here
C:	yeah yeah and even if that doesn't work then it'll be brought up and maybe it'll allow me to talk to my boss further about it and maybe he'll understand really where I'm coming from but this will at least be a start to something you know how to make me a lot less stressed with deadlines and stuff
T:	you are frustrated with all this
C:	yeah but maybe maybe after I do that you know put in the complaint or suggestion
T:	mm-hmm
C:	maybe I won't be as frustrated I'm gonna feel a little bit less frustrated now even thinking if there is another opportunity
T:	it feels better now as you're contemplating and another potential Avenue here
C:	yeah yeah
T:	well this might be a good place to wrap this session up that feels like the right move for you
C:	yeah
T:	and well schedule so I see you next week and we can pick up from there
C:	sounds good
T:	all right cool thanks Carl
C:	thank you
