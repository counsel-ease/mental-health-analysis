C:	yeah sure okay 
T:	so why don't we start by you telling me a bit about your day and the struggles you're having to include exercise where that those barriers are coming up and 
C:	so my day it's just there's so much I have family have kids on the job and there's so many active self-care activities that come along with being a diabetic again throwing exercise into it it's just it's so overwhelming and it could so dis encourage cuz I just can't find the time for it 
T:	okay so you're I hear that you're struggling to find time to fit exercise into your schedule and you're starting to feel pretty frustrated and discouraged with the situation 
C:	yeah I just I don't know what to do anymore because
T:	okay well how important is this change to you how much do you want to make this change in your life um let's say from a on the scale from zero to ten with the CEO being not important to me at all attending very important to me
C:	well I being it I've been so long I've learned a lot about it and I know exercise a major contributor to my diabetic health so I would say it's pretty important maybe a seven
T:	okay okay very important and how confident would you say you are about making this change right now 
C:	maybe a two
T:	okay so from what I hear you saying you've had some success in the past without cheating behaviors related to your diabetes it's just life is just simply getting really right now so you have been successful in the past and it sounds like incorporating exercise into your schedule is going to be another really difficult change that you're not sure you want to make but is important to you is that correct 
C:	yeah but it's it's sound like it might be just a little too difficult for me I maybe I shouldn't have come here and Florent wasting your time you know what 
T:	I'm glad you didn't come in today it shows that you really care about your health and you want to manage your diabetes better I'm sure it was really difficult to come in today especially since you're not sure you want to make this change 
C:	yeah I I definitely know how important it is that have exercise it's a part of being a diabetic so I just I don't know how I'm gonna do it I don't the time for oh so it does sound like you know the importance of exercise for a diabetic and at the same time life is life is getting in the way right now yeah it's like I said it's very important to me and do want these things for my health I just I don't know how to do it 
T:	so from what I hear you saying um you're having difficulty fitting exercise into your schedule and you know the importance of exercise for diabetics what would it be beneficial to you if I provide you with a little more information would that be okay 
C:	oh yeah definitely sure please I would like to know about them
T:	okay well but you exercise can help lower your blood glucose and that's important for diabetics and I can all also help lower your blood pressure regular exercise can also increase your energy improve your sleep strengthen your bones muscles there are a lot of benefits which one of those benefits do you think you would appreciate the most energy I'm really glad to help how can you say that like
C:	I would love to have more energy to do the things I do throughout the day and I definitely don't sleep well at night so I didn't even know these were things that came along with exercise and diabetes like having the energy to go through my day and being able to sleep and be awesome actually
T:	it sounds like you're getting kind of excited something that connects my life and like it makes sense right so you'd really you'd really benefit from including exercise oh and it sounds like you're really willing to try to change can you think of some ways you might include exercise in your day
C:	yeah I would love to try harder to make this change and I guess if you if you talk about including ways in the mornings I go to work around  and then take my kids to school but I Drive them back so maybe okay 
T:	do you think you'd be able to how often would you be able to walk them to school this week
C:	I assume they go to school every day yeah so I can try for all five days 
T:	okay that would be great 
C:	yeah
T:	so would you you'd be able to walk them to school every day and maybe keep a track of that you've done it for the day and maybe just check it often that way you know you know you've got your exercise in 
C:	yeah I couldn't try to do that this week 
T:	okay so now that we've discussed these things a bit how one confident are you feeling nail that you have the resources and skills to make this change
C:	well definitely knowing that and have these things impact my health and all these other issues that are facing might be related to this and definitely encourage her and also I didn't know something so small is just taking my kids to school is exercise so I'm very confident now maybe even an eighth okay
