T:	Lisa are you doing 
C:	I'm all right just a little tired today alright well 
T:	so what's what's going on
C:	I'm just sick and tired I won't have a regular life or normal life like everybody else and it's very it's just I'm just so sick of nobody's helping me I do everything by myself and you know I have all these kids you know they running around and you know acting crazy and i'm just i'm tired of but they'd out of my husband he runs around and do what he do and I was just sick and tired of having it live like this I thought you know as a child when I grow up as an adult life is gonna be so much better but it's not it's it's just like whatever well I don't do what I can to try to make sure my kids have with a
T:	well so you're doing your best but but pretty pretty disappointed in the way things are for you these nights not seeing a whole lot of its kind of kind it is kind of your life isn't it I mean you guys kids what it is 
C:	i mean i have to make sure that i take care of them I'm because who else will I don't have anybody to help me I have no support yeah I have to make sure they get well
T:	for spore small kids and one of them being baby nuts and 
C:	she's all over the place I mean she's pulling down stuff and and is how to go behind and pick it up and so now just they forget it just let her throw it down on floor oh my
T:	gosh gets to a point where you pretty much give up 
C:	yeah and I'm just sitting in just watcher and I make sure she doesn't get anything in her mouth 
T:	with still having the priority of you know safety you know you're still looking out for her that way but it's kind of gotten you you're getting kind of worn down
C:	yeah I am I am sometime I just feel you know like I don't want to live and I'm like what if I don't I'm not here you know there maybe it'll be better but then I start thinking it can you know gosh these kids are here you know my husband is not doing what he's supposed to do so who's gonna take care of my mom is getting older and I I'll try to tough it out
T:	oh gosh I'm sorry it's getting that point pretty pretty pretty helpless
C:	I am I just try to deal with y'all smell that what we need you in there and it relaxing me I'm the chilling and you know I'm on cloud nine for a minute but then I commenter Errol in this deal here
T:	provides maybe a temporary temporary escape but it never doesn't change anything all right so whatever what are some other things that you're doing that maybe you feel are helpful 
C:	well nothing really i like the right and i really do i like to write but I don't write I like to read but I don't really read it much so um you know I try to write and I just don't have time it to get tired and I Spit on the bed and or I was sitting on a chair fall asleep but look at TV and so probably smoking smoking me home I don't really like to drink much but I might I'm gonna change them socially have a dream
T:	well its own so long and so you liked it you like to read and you liked write yeah and and kind of the classic thing that happens right when you when you start to feel depressed when you start to really get depressed that's exactly what happens the things that we really enjoy the things that really fulfill us are the things that we that we start to not do anymore even though it's like even though you know you've always enjoyed it I you just don't feel like doing you just kind of get to a point where you're like just you know it's not like I saw you perk up I mean you talk about it your eyes just lit up you know the way you talk about you like to write and you have a passion there so it sounds like that's something that if you if you were doing that that would be an indication that you're you're doing better you feel good 
C:	yeah i think i would but when i have time yeah and that's not a thing I say well maybe I could do it at night when I put the kids to be a nigger but then you know we're getting somewhere I can't die on the paper you know it might be over there my notebook is somewhere else and I just say well you know I may be good tomorrow right 
T:	well I and I think we all experience that I mean it's that kind of you know even though it's something you like sometimes it's it does take kind of taught it does take time and it takes energy and when you're tired you know you don't always feel like it and that's part of it too is it that you know i i'm sure the writing in and of itself is a very rewarding thing but then it's in order to write you have to have time to yourself and it sounds like that's something that you sure don't have much
C:	no and you think feels gonna come in here and i'll take the key it so i can write no this is outside playing with motorcycles and cars and you know and probably chasing women I don't know but you know it's just crazy so he's not going to do anything I thought husband supposed to be son Isaac suppose we ate or he'll miss fortune
T:	well I heard you mentioned earlier something about your husband some concerns you're having about the relationship so so maybe just to get a sense of there are a few things going on I mean one is you've got the feet feeling pretty down feeling pretty down feeling pretty overwhelmed with being a home all the time with the kids and not having time for yourself not having a break not being able to get away so one is you don't have the time to get away like you don't have many opportunities when you do you're pretty well exhausted and don't really feel like doing the things that you have enjoyed in the past like reading and writing and then so one of the things you've done to try to cope is is smoking marijuana which you know seems to help for a little bit but then when you come back it's everything's the same and so it seems like you're not getting a tremendous amount out of that and then you've got your husband who you're in this you know you've got real concerns real questions about what's going on with him and you're not feeling entirely supported and and you've got questions about its fidelity alright
C:	that's another story we'll be here all day okay all right well 
T:	so out of everything out of all of that I mean what do you think is the thing that how do you think we could best use our time
C:	I just want to be normal that's one of a normal life but I guess just give me just wanting to probably started out looking for a job I need a job right now so that was probably  I didn't really mean it early but that's I needed a job okay well it's certainly a star Oh kind of be a star all right 
T:	so certainly I mean that would influence a lot of the other things and I mean that would hell I'm you'd be getting out of the house and you have money and all those kinds of things any of you thought about kind of like how that would work in terms of taking care of the baby if you had a job you'd be able to maybe someone to help out with the beach 
C:	I think well I told my husband that he's gonna have to step up and you know I'll be willing to get a third shift but he's gonna step up and you know take care of the baby throughout the night okay so then when the kids get up for school I'm coming home and he just get them up and with hair and family it's kind of taken alone all right so I have thought about 
T:	yeah you got you've got a real plan in mind okay i just got to get out then the four job okay i have all my right of the main everything is ready but I just Evan at a time
T:	ok ok thank you
