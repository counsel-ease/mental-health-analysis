T:	hello Neil hi hi ding 
C:	hi um I guess I want to talk about the stress see us where we left off last time and how is this still building 
T:	still there 
C:	it's still there I feel like I haven't I've been able to deal with it if no we've been able to identify I haven't been able to make any significant change
T:	you've not be able to deal with it or make any significant change 
C:	no I tried try different things I've flooded force myself to get around it by forcing myself into new work 
T:	mm-hmm
C:	but it doesn't seem to happen I've found myself sitting to the computer I've got my books I'm open I get Word document up I know I should be there but I have no motivation whatsoever to do it
T:	now you you've been making efforts in to try and forcing yourself to do the work you set out the things needed to be done the computer the software and the box but then like you wait for something to happen 
C:	hmm yeah like this you guys I sit there feeling frustrated as I'm at it yeah that I I can't get the work done and I know that if if it keeps going how it is at the moment I keep going how I am at the moment I'm not going I I'm not going to get my work and I'm not going to do work and that means failing University 
T:	you'll be fairly University
C:	which ends up let me give you having to give up and go home and I know that's not why one I definitely want to be here but I just can't seem to focus on my work 
T:	so you kind of want to be here because it's not going home where you don't want to return to and staying here has consequences in that you're required to work required to do specific tasks specific job specific projects I get that something gets in the way of you working 
C:	yeah yeah this doesn't help well Holmes I'm still a myth missing lectures I'm sleeping in in the mornings again have no motivation to get up in the morning roll over just turn off my alarm clock just don't seem to be bothered about it 
T:	so it's not just not being able to do the work there's also something of not going in two lectures to university maybe not getting any more work 
C:	yeah Hey hmm I can see it all building up and I know this is a deadline just coming and if I don't get the work done then don't think about that 
T:	there's a consequence of getting not getting the work done okay where I'm afraid that we're out of time for now so we need to stop
