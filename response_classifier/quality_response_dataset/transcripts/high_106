T:	honey I think you have a fairly uncomplicated respiratory infection I don't see anything that would indicate a need for antibiotics what I would suggest I'll give you the name of a cough suppressant that you can buy over the counter and I think it should run its course within the next few days 
C:	okay
T:	good I also notice you filled out one of our questionnaires could I look up your question there give a bit feedback that he all right? okay and just to clarify from my information on average how many days a week would you have a drink that contains um alcohol? 
C:	um I don't drink very often if I go out to dinner with my friends I may have one or two glasses of wine 
T:	okay and about how often would that be?
C:	um like every other month I guess maybe go out to dinner
T:	okay and only and one or two drinks when you have a drink?
C:	yes mm-hmm um 
T:	in the past three months a notice you filled out our drug use questionnaire can you tell me what drugs you used any street drugs or any prescription drugs in a way that was not prescribed? 
C:	um prescription sure if I only use those as their prescribed but i have used marijuana or i do use marijuana occasionally 
T:	okay not about how often would you use marijuana? 
C:	maybe two or three times a month 
T:	mm-hmm and on a typical day that you smoke marijuana about how much would you smoke too many joints?
C:	um well I'm usually with friends and um looks like they'll roll a blunt and we'll pass it around a couple of times I guess I may have anywhere from seven to eight pups I guess sohini mm-hmm just you know it depends on how many up there's of us there are when it goes around 
T:	okay all right well your score on this questionnaire is a  out of a possible  points would you like to know a little bit more about what your score means? 
C:	yes please
T:	we have a little diagram that we use to represent people's risk levels there are people with no use that would have no risk and others that are drinking I'm sorry smoking perhaps on a very frequent or even daily level that would be in a high-risk group but your use puts you in this middle zone which indicates that you do have some risk related to your marijuana use what are your thoughts about that? 
C:	Mike at risk for what 
T:	well marijuana is a drug that affects learning and memory and coordination and so on the days that you do smoke marijuana more likely to have an accident a fall or if you're driving maybe an auto accident there's some other health effects some of the ones that I worried the most about anxiety and depression and especially paranoid ideations and schizophrenia you ever had any problems when you were out smoking marijuana with friends?
C:	um well yeah recently the last time that we were smoking I did experience some paranoia and that that wasn't a good feeling at all that really scare me 
T:	okay so that's pretty frightening very yeah well can you give me a little more idea some of the good things some of the reasons that you do smoke marijuana you like to do that? 
C:	um no you know just it kind of helps you to relax kind of mellow out it's not something that I plan to do is just if my friends are smoking and I'm around then I will you know joining in um it's just you know that social thing is I really didn't see it as a big deal
T:	yeah so it's a social thing something that you do to sort of be a part of the group and it helps you relax a little any not-so-good things you mentioned one thing that's 
C:	yeah you're ready yeah well whenever I smoke you know I'm always concerned about my job testing for for dress because they do random drug tests and I really can't afford to lose my job and the paranoia was really scary for me that that last time that was the first time I had ever experienced that and it was just no real crazy whoa crazy 
T:	so on the one hand you have this opportunity to relax a little bit and just enjoy spending time with your friends on the other hand you've got some things that have made you concerned the paranoia really scares you and you're also really concerned about the possibility that get drug tested that might endanger your job so where does that that leave you in terms of continuing to smoke about like you are now or maybe quitting or reducing what you're doing?
C:	well after i had that um that experience with the paranoia that really scared me and so it was something that you know I was like I really you know don't want to do this I don't want to have this feeling anymore so I think it may be better if I just leave it alone 
T:	yeah might be time to quit yeah you know as your physician I would say that's a great decision because none of these bad things would happen T as least as a consequence of your drug use if you quit quit completely so I think that's a that's a great choice what would you say if if you go out with your friends? you sounds like you do that on a regular basis next time you go out you say no I how are you gonna say no?
C:	um you know I really haven't thought about it it's just there's something I have to really think about how to to to deal with it when it happens yeah so I 
T:	put a little thought into that some people talk about their health or problems that they've had or some people just say I made a decision I don't want to do yeah yeah you can kind of think through those and come up with something that you think would work for you and your situation and the people that you go out on with 
C:	I think they'll understand that has that parent being paranoid you know and just them seeing me that way I think don't understand if I say no uh-huh 
T:	so someone were actually upon expiry yes yeah so that may help them understand well I think that's a great decision Tonya as i said i want to give you today some information i'll write out the name of that cough suppressant for you okay and you know i'll see you for your next annual vision when that comes due or are you know how to find us before then if you need us 
C:	okay all right 
T:	good well thanks for talking with me about this today I know these are not the easiest things to talk but I think you've demonstrated some really clear thinking and let me know if there's any way I can help 
C:	okay thank you
