T:	okay I see that you've filled it here before
C:	mm-hmm
T:	tell me about how you're using the insulin
C:	okay um so usually at night I'll check my blood sugar and then if it's pretty high like about like 15 or so I'll use it that day so usually end up using it about three or four times a week
T:	so you're testing a lot
C:	mm-hmm
T:	at least every day
C:	yes
T:	and then you are using the unplanned when you feel like your blood sugars are running high
C:	even exactly
T:	and how do you feel your implants working for that
C:	I think it's good because my sugars aren't about 14 every day so it must be working it must work her maybe even a couple of days so it's pretty effective
T:	do you feel like you've seen some real improvements on that
C:	yeah definitely
T:	okay so tell me why you're only using it when your blood sugar goes high
C:	oh okay yeah so I was supposed to use it everyday at first I think um which I was like the first week that I had it I started injecting everyday I don't carry about a week it's your to hurt when I was inject here so that's when I started doing it less often thinking if I kind of gave this skin a couple days to heal it wouldn't hurt as much by the next time I I gave myself the injection
T:	so you were experiencing some pain who knows what I'd like you to kind of use it a little left off
C:	yeah it hurts a lot when I check
T:	and you feel like that's really impacting your day
C:	mm-hmm I do yeah
T:	okay so sounds like you've seen some improvement your blood Sugar's have been sometimes under control what have you discuss with your doctor recently
C:	um why has she haven't seen my doctor since I started the insulin so I guess I haven't told him I'm not using it every day like he wanted I hope you I hope you understand
T:	well you're here today for the refill and it seems like you're really committed to getting your blood Sugar's under control
C:	mm-hmm
T:	there are some options that we could discuss about how to reduce pain when you inject
