T:	Hello Lean my name is Karen and your sis this afternoon nice to meet you nice to meet you so how are you feeling okay
ï»¿T:	burns a little bit but I'm just waiting for the doctor to check my stitches then I'm going home
T:	well it's great that's a good thing that you're going home soon um I have ten minutes that I can maybe sit down and talk with you if you have answers or questions for me is there anything that you'd like to talk to me about 
C:	um not really but honestly this is really bugging me this priest came in here and gave me this wire for a and I'm kind of offended like why would he give listen to me I don't know so just bothers me so you say that a priest came by and gave you this brochure for alcoholic anonymous 
T:	yeah yeah and it's just is really upsetting you because you don't think that you need 
C:	I'm not an alcoholic
T:	you don't believe that you're an alcoholic oh I mean I could understand how upset you can be people think that you're something that you're not great um would you like us to explore a bit more about you know why is what do you think that the priest gave you this did you have any ideas why you would hand you such like a brochure like this
C:	Oh Bonnie I guess it kind of makes sense because I'm here because I got into a partner right and I got hurt so maybe he just thought you know bar fight she's got to be a drunk maybe that's what he thought
T:	okay so would you like to tell me a bit more butch his bar fight that you like
C:	honestly I don't remember much because I know I was drinking I was having some fun with my friends but I think I guess this girl just got to me and and sometimes I get a little crazy and I don't know what happened but I know I hurt now so you got into a bar fight
T:	right and and you you would jump Harry oh yeah and you didn't know what was really going on but you know you just think that maybe this girl was not saying something good to you and then you get into this fight 
C:	yeah 
T:	okay um would you let would you allow me to explore a little bit more about the drinking and alcohol
C:	it's really okay 
T:	so how does alcohol affect you like what what does he do for you is doing it like 
C:	I like it it's fun I go out with my friends and we go drinking and like after work it's like the best way to just chill you know is to have a beer just relax so for me it's fun and it's my way of just relaxing and hanging out with my friends 
T:	yeah I understand so you you like having fun your friends drinking is a normal thing for you guys to do and you don't see a problem with what you're doing with your friends like you're just drinking one 
C:	I'm not driving um you know yeah it's just fun
T:	so it seems to me that drinking is not really a problem that you in your life right now um but would you say though that there are some negative effects that that alcohol is doing in your life right now it would you like to tell me if it's affecting you in that way?
C:	well I mean I I'm kind of cut up so that's not a good thing related to my drinking I guess Joey he's my boyfriend he really doesn't like it when I'm drinking and we get into a lot of fights and he says I'm just not normal when I drink so I guess that would be the negative stuff 
T:	so I like it he said your friends drink you drinking is fun something fun but on the flip side and the bad side it's affecting your relationship with your boyfriend he does not like it the way you act are you drinking so it is affecting the relationship negative rate okay um so back in the Alcoholics Anonymous if you of mine I'm so we what do you know about a it's a meeting for people who drink 
C:	mm-hmm
T:	talk about it okay so you know under your the right track about you know people meeting it's a group of people um that talk about alcohol okay so with your boyfriend it sounds to me that is what you say is how Koren is he in your life marry that guy he's important we're gonna be like together okay so that's great you know at least you're thinking about a feature with Joe and you think that he's really important in your life right now um and then you also said that he does not agree with the drinking I would like to ask you this question now would you be willing to take it a step further and maybe check that 
C:	I check out one of these programs 
T:	for the sake of your relationship is that something that you're willing to look at willing to in the future
C:	yeah or never thought of it before but I'm willing
T:	um so okay I would like to give you a scale of  to  in a scale one to  how likely would you go and check out one of these programs is 
C:	sex sex Elton
T:	so you would say to safe that's very surprising because it's not a one like it's very good why would you say it's not a one and it's a six that you're likely to go 
C:	because of Joey like he doesn't like me drinking hmm I mean I'm only  it's not affecting my health now but I know when I get older and really affect my health and Joey won't stop babies and he keeps telling me I can't drink and if I want to get pregnant 
T:	so I mean those are the things that's really I recommend it for that you're thinking about a future Joey you're thinking that maybe you'll have children with him someday and if you do try you think that it will make your relationship better which one factor should be a good way how well he said it's a six right so what do you think would happen would need to happen to make it a nine for you that you really like most likely to just go in and try one of these programs 
C:	well I guess like if the place was closed then if I like the people there and if I got something out of it then it would make me go 
T:	okay that sounds good and it sounds reasonable that if it's closer to you it's easier for you to stop by 
C:	yeah
T:	um if you'd like if you're interested I would be able to help you find a place a closer area where the program is hell it's easier for you to to get there it's closer to your house would you be willing to find out a bit more about that 
C:	sure yeah 
T:	okay so thank you for talking to me about this whatever village for Joey and how alcohol is maybe affecting your relationship and you know and your may be willing to go and try one of these programs would you like to meet up with me in the next two weeks and see how how this program is to you like if you've tried it if you have any more questions or concerns for me look at where you are at in this situation is that something to do it 
C:	yeah I did you later 
T:	okay so Thank You Leanne um this is a big stuff for you I know I'm it's hard to make a step like this but I'm thankful that we have this stuff today and I hope to see you again soon you're too weak
