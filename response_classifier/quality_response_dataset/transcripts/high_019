T:	hello Pepe how you doing today
C:	okay how are you
T:	I'm good thanks for asking I understand you've come here today to the agency because you have a recent arrest
C:	yeah um I got a DUI for being under the influence of alcohol marijuana
T:	alcohol marijuana how recently was this DUI
C:	Um about a week ago
T:	okay so what's been going on what is gonna happen
C:	um well I am gonna have to go to court soon and I know that I'm probably gonna have to get some type of like treatment or something like that but I really just don't want to so I just I'm just coming here because I don't know maybe I can like get out of it if I'm getting some type of treatment but I don't know
T:	get out of it you mean gonna have the charge
C:	yeah I mean I feel like they're probably gonna make me like go to rehab or something like that I want to do that
T:	so you feel like you can get out of the rehab part too-
C:	um I don't know I really am Not sure I just know that I don't know getting in getting the DUI is kind of just made me realize I like me to make it change but I'm just not ready to stop drinking or using marijuana there's just like the only things that like really help me in my life
T:	all right so with this recent arrest you realize it may be about you to stop using but really don't want to
C:	mm-hmm yeah
T:	so you're stuck there
C:	yeah it kind of like I would like realized that like drinking and using marijuana hasn't like got me anywhere positive really but it's like the only thing that like I know I just that's all I do usually and it's all in that mix we ever like feel better
T:	when you drink do you ever socialize at the same time
C:	I mean sometimes I'll like go to bars and things like that but most of the times just like that I am at my house
T:	alone safety of the marijuana
C:	yeah I mean I'd like a few people that always smoke with but usually just kinda by myself I mean I smoke every day so thought it was with people I'm doing it
T:	so doesn't sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using
C:	no not really
T:	what are you losing
C:	I kind of just like use it to like cope I got like I have a brain injury that I got like a while ago like it still causes pain and that's just the only thing that ever seemed to help once after the injury
T:	this is the alcohol in there one
C:	mm-hmm
T:	so you take it for pain relief equalities
C:	yeah
T:	any other reasons
C:	um it's just easier it's just the marijuana like relaxes me it's just easier to kind of like forget about things when I'm using
T:	like forget about problems
C:	yeah
T:	so it affects your mood in a positive way
C:	yeah like I get like I'd like the feeling once I'm drunk and then if I'm feeling like anxious or anything like that like the marijuana helps with that so then just it's easier to like I don't feel anything so I don't have to worry I don't have to deal with any negative feelings
T:	have you used since you had the DUI
C:	um I haven't drank but I've smoked like I've cut back on my smoking a little bit but I'm still using
T:	alright it's been a bit of a situation all right so you have the use takes away pain for you it takes away anxiety feels good but then you have these consequences of the law
C:	yeah
T:	how do you figure those two things out
C:	I don't know I don't know if there's a way to figure both of my I just know like not I just couldn't imagine not drinking you not using marijuana he had imagined it
T:	all right so you can't imagine that so was it at the other side can you imagine having further incensed with law enforcement more charges in the future
C:	um I guess I hadn't really considered that I mean that I don't want there today I guess I would want this to kind of like go as smoothly as possible not get any more charges or anything like that not be in this situation again
T:	so you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not I really have a consequence and you'll be more careful in the future
C:	Um I don't know yeah I guess so I guess I probably just wouldn't drive if I like was just turning like right before try to like avoid that situation again
T:	so with that thinking you could continue to use as you were that you would take out the part that got you in trouble
C:	yeah
T:	the first you have to get out of trouble this time
C:	yep
T:	so if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it
C:	I just couldn't imagine getting to a place where that wasn't what was like helping me and then to like I don't I drink mostly by myself but I couldn't imagine like if my friends called me up and said hey do you want to go out tonight like not drinking with them
T:	so there is a social component here
C:	yeah a little bit I drink mainly by myself just because all my friends work like 95 jobs they don't drink every day but I do but like on the weekends and things like all of my friends who I do have they all do drink all right
T:	so you know if you had no anxiety no pain you'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends how would they respond if you went out with them and didn't drink
C:	um they probably just like wouldn't understand it because we all go out when we got like really drunken I would just feel like out of place
T:	so it'd be socially awkward
C:	yeah
T:	straining the relationships with your friends
C:	mm-hmm
T:	so the quitting and alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good route for you
C:	No not at all
T:	but then you have this this recent situation which is making you second-guess some of it
C:	yeah I mean it's making me think that like maybe I I need to like make a change I just can't see that that's the change I'm making
T:	so you need to make some change
C:	yeah
T:	but not the alcohol and drugs
C:	yeah
T:	something else could change
C:	yeah I don't know what
T:	you have any theories
C:	I mean I just thinking like just like cutting back on it and like not drinking and driving obviously because that's what like got me into this situation don't like other than that really and I really have really thought of what I could do
T:	so you could reduce your usage avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety in the pain
C:	I don't know it might just not go anywhere ever right not sure drive is often
T:	mmm
C:	because I don't know if I would if I'd be able to cut back drinking enough to like not have to like feel okay
T:	hmm so that strategy might not work
C:	I guess not
T:	that's something you've been tossing around though this idea of isolating a little bit more and drinking a little less seems like all your options here kind of grim
C:	yeah
T:	is that just is that just me or does it seem that way to you to
C:	now that I'm like talking through it yeah and I don't think I have any choice really
T:	you don't have any choice what's gonna happen it's going to happen
C:	I don't know
T:	all right so let's start with early know or pick up with what we know you don't want to make a bad impression in this whole court proceeding with the DUI what do you think you could do that would make a bad person
C:	Um go to court wrong test positive if I get drug tested
T:	That would do it
C:	I would do it get another DUI in the meantime
T:	that wouldn't look good either all right so you want to avoid those behaviors for sure so you know for sure you don't want it those things would it be acceptable to do those things
C:	I mean not really I mean I think I could avoid the nollie drunk-driving enough or maybe not to drank the day of my court date but I don't know about the whole you marijuana part
T:	that's tougher
C:	yeah
T:	all right so would you appreciate those as goals like avoiding those situations like going in the court drunk
C:	yeah
T:	goals that you could get behind
C:	um I mean I can try I guess so like think about it and try to get out there I know I'm gonna be stressed out the day of my court dates are it's gonna be hard to like not drink that day
T:	you're not striking me as overly enthusiastic about this idea
C:	No I am not
T:	this is really tough for you the alcohol
C:	um
T:	the marijuana that are important to you
C:	yeah
T:	this whole DUI thing  it's really just encroached on something you had going on that you enjoyed
C:	yeah
T:	so is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life event that does change things
C:	Um I don't know because I don't know any other like way around it than just dealing with it I mean if I like don't go to court or anything that's gonna warrant out for me like I can't I can't avoid this situation
T:	what if as a condition of your treatment the judge says no more drinking in no more marijuana period legacy to that you obey those rules or or jail
C:	I don't know if it would I get to that I know it possibly could that probably will but I I don't know
T:	I would think it almost certainly would have
C:	yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't imagine like not drinking and using drugs I'm sure I would like leave court that day thinking I would but I don't know what happened when I get home for the next day or that day
T:	let's go back a couple of steps how long have you been using the alcohol marijuana
C:	for about like six years
T:	six years
T:	have you ever until now with the DUI have you ever envisioned stopping
C:	no
T:	what's your plan like what pre DUI well is your plan in all this
C:	I just I did like the jerking kind of has gotten worse it wasn't always that bad I've always used marijuana but the alcohol is I guess I've been using a little bit more recently so I didn't really ever have a plan the marijuana never really looked affected my life too much but I guess the alcohol has been a little bit more
T:	yeah so without this or something you would have continued using yeah for years to come
C:	yeah I didn't really have any like I never like thought I want to stop doing this or anything like that or had a reason to or
T:	till now
C:	yeah
T:	could this be in a strange way like an opportunity
C:	I mean I guess if I had if I wanted to stop this would be a way for me to stop or a reason for me to stop
T:	if you really wanted to stop could you stop
C:	I don't know may I guess I could try but I don't have that one
T:	you could give it a shot you're just not sure you could you could actually do it
C:	yeah I mean I've never tried to before so I don't know
T:	it's just unknown
C:	yeah yeah
T:	so where do you want to go from here you have this DUI I imagine a hearing or some type coming up right here to see me what can I do to help you
C:	um I guess yes help me figure out whether or not like I do want to stop drinking or using drugs I mean that might be something that I have to do right now I don't really want to so I don't know if I could like get to a place where I actually do want to stop it'd be easier to actually do it then
T:	like a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality
C:	yeah
T:	okay do you want to work on that
C:	yeah
T:	all right so between now I'm going to see again do you have any hearings or anything coming up
C:	no they're not for like a few more weeks
T:	a few more weeks so I'll see you again I know you have the IOP and everything here I'll see you again in a week and let's pick up with that anything changes we're hearing is moved up just snubby now
C:	okay
T:	thanks Pepe
C:	thank you
