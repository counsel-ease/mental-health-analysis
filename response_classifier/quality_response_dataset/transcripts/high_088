T:	I can't how you doing today 
C:	I'm doing all right not doing so bad are you done today
T:	nothing thanks for asking what brings you in 
C:	um so my girlfriend saw your ad in the paper and she saw like out of some of the things that you work on one of them is smoking cessation and it bothers her that that I smoke so she has been nagging me for like weeks to come in and talk to you so I figured I would just kind of come in just so she would stop bugging me about it 
T:	so you came into therapy today because your girlfriend pressured you 
C:	yeah I mean it's just it's easier for me like if I come in here and talk to you like that's it I can spend like  minutes with you compared to hours of her nagging me through the week so
T:	so you weighed the cost benefit and decided to come in 
C:	yeah I mean it's covered by insurance it's just  minutes of my time but
T:	and what she would like you to do and this is her goal not yours would be to stop smoking
C:	yeah
T:	tell me what your goal is 
C:	I mean I don't really have one like I I don't think smoking is that bad well I mean I don't know smoking can be bad but like it doesn't it's never bothered me like I I don't know it's like I really don't have any goals to come in besides just having her cell phone you may 
T:	so do you have a goal of quitting smoking 
C:	yeah no there's no there's like so many good things about smoking like what really got me into it was I smoked a lot of work because it gives me like one-on-one time with the boss so like the fact that I can get that time with my bosses I make a little bit worth it 
T:	can you tell me does some of the other good things possible 
C:	um it's just like it's how I meet people so like if I like I'll have cigarettes on me but like I don't have a lighter and that kind of like keeps me from fishing off the pack because I could fish off a pack a day but if I don't have a lighter than like I carry the cigarettes around with me and then if I see other people are smoking I can go and ask for a light and that's always kind of like a way in to get to these groups and like I've just met so many different people from from smoking like 
T:	so smoking the way you're presenting it there's been a positive thing in your life 
C:	yeah I mean I'm like I want to do it socially so that's yeah 
T:	are there any negative aspects to smoking
C:	I mean yeah I mean I one you everyone knows smoking is unhealthy but like I don't I don't smoke a lot like I only only smoke from time to time but it's mostly just on the weekends so it's like I don't know in case you buy smoker for the weekends I might have like a coffee maybe like a heavy a call from Mondays Tuesdays part of me is gone by Wednesday so it's not really that big of a deal
T:	you don't seem like you're too worried about the the negative aspects 
C:	no I mean like the obviously is unhealthy but like one of the things I'm trying to do in my life now is get out there and meet new people and like the benefit of being able to do that smoking is better than like giving it up for health reasons I think 
T:	so let me ask you a question I want you to give a response between - this is called scaling and is to do it the importance of stopping smoking so one would be it's not important to you and  would be it's extremely important where do you think you'd put that number
C:	I don't know maybe like like a - like it'd be cool if you order the coffee on Mondays but that getting rid of that is not worth everything else I get from sweating 
T:	so not particularly important
C:	yeah
T:	now let me ask you the same question except instead of importance how confident or how about confidence how confident are you that you could quit smoking on a scale once to have one being not confident all and ten being extremely confident 
C:	I could say probably like an eight or a nine like I could I could give it up actually I gave it up recently like for like a month and I didn't even crave it but eventually like just seeing all my friends got smoking like I missed that so I just starting up again but I don't know right like if I really wanted to give it up for good I'm sure I could 
T:	sostopping smoking is not important to you but you're fairly confident you could if you decided you would so based on kind of where you are in terms of it doesn't seem like you're interested in stopping smoking what would be a goal how could we spend this time so that it would be productive 
C:	I don't know like I guess who would it would help to be able to like explain to my girlfriend like like the stuff that I get from smoking and like you you seen you kind of seem like you get it so like I don't know maybe you figure out ways to like explains or her the things that I get from smoking to like I don't just kind of help her like realize why I do it other than just to kill myself 
T:	so to help her to understand why the smoking works for you yeah that's that's one goal there any other goals you could think of I mean you came in in part because you're well soon here like you came in completely because your girlfriend pressured it yeah so any other relational goals so my work on there
C:	I don't know we haven't really been like we've been fighting a lot because of the smoking mm-hmm so I think like maybe figuring out ways like to maybe communicate better or like having like good fights in a way like I don't understand that but like having fights that are productive like that just don't always and like with us just like going our separate ways or like one of us living in the house but like I guess being able to like wrap up a fight so it doesn't last for like days it's a
T:	productive communication and productive arguments right yeah yeah so so one goal would be to illustrate clearly the advantages of smoking to your girlfriend where actually understands how important it is to you yeah because it does seem like it's really important but another would be to work on your relation your relational style so that you you can end argument feel like you're not in a stalemate right 
C:	yeah yeah that's gonna be cool all right
T:	well you want to make those the goals that we work one so that we can spend this time yeah I can do it that it's kind of like killing two birds with one stone don't make sense to you hmm well that's what we'll do so wait like you do I'll see you again and about a week right right so if you could reflect on some of these changes do you think you can make with this relationship well you could do in the relationship to be a more effective communicator because a lot of this revolves around communication oh yeah communicating the advantages of smoking but also communicating in the arguing so that you have to end to these arguments right it's really more moving from arguments to collegial conversations that have a positive result yeah yeah that would be cool we can do that okay so if you could work on kind of thinking that through and then the next time we meet we'll talk about those different goals and maybe ways to make some small changes you know in that relationship to to meet those goals right all right suck it all right thanks for coming in con man thank you
