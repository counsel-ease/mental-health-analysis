T:	hi Jerry how are you doing today 
C:	good how are you 
T:	I'm good things just wondering how you've been doing since you at the hospital 
C:	um yeah that's what I've had are we laughs from my depression but I've been doing go with it for the past few months and I've been on some antidepressants and I've been having some going to group therapy so that's been helping me a lot and then I kind of smoking a lot but some pad a lot Ollie asthma flare ups and shortness of breath
T:	so you're making some progress so in a group therapy improving with your depression but you're experiencing some symptoms from your asthma you do a bit more about that 
C:	yeah that's what I can't really run as far and like this when I'm going for a little walk from anywhere I kind of have short power beyond shortness of breath and I just get fatigued really easily I just kind of noticed that how about longstone function like they used to 
T:	okay so you're getting some shortness of breath and fatigue really easily would it be okay with you if we talked a little bit about your smoking today 
C:	um I didn't really come in here for a terminal had that much time so i don't know i was just like to get back on with the appointment
T:	okay I mean I totally understand that that's a difficult subject to talk about and it's completely up to you I just would like to talk about it with you because I do think and have some magnificent on your health today I'm worried about how it's affecting you in your day-to-day life would it be okay if we talk about your health issues and we can kind of slowly talk about it get into that will take a while we keep making a squeaker as long as you want this is your time and we're here for you 
C:	okay i guess i'm going to talk about it for a little bit 
T:	ok so in your everyday life how else has being affected you other than the shortness of breath and the fatigue that you've been experiencing 
C:	um well I'm around my my knees often and my my brother hasn't really want me to washing her unless I like stopped smoking because she gets all the second hand smoke and my my dad died from lung cancer so they kind of suspected that was from smoking so that kind of scares me 
T:	okay so that's a negative aspect of smoking for you is that you can't be around your niece and that your father has died from smoking so let's talk about maybe some of the positive things that smoking guys for you 
C:	um that's what it kind of helps with my depression it kind of relaxes me I feel like if I stop smoking it would probably make me relapse and i would start having the suicidal feelings again and also it's kind of like a social aspect where I kind of hang out with my friends and
T:	okay so now let's talk about the opposite side we're going to talk about the pros and cons of stopping smoking so what would be some of the negative things if you stop if you decide to stop smoking 
C:	um I guess I want to be able to hang out with my niece as much as I would like to I might follow along the same path as my dad and I mean I'm sure my lungs would probably get worse if I keep smelling my asthma probably get worse 
T:	so your eyes one would get worse you can't be with your niece is often and you would be going along the same path as your dad which is ultimately death so let's talk about the positive things of stopping 
C:	I know I would say a lot of money I would probably have less symptoms my asthma unless short of breath and how you see my knees were and I prod us have an overall better life as much smoke smell my clothes 
T:	so after we kind of talked about the pros and cons ultimately you have a lot of pros to that you enjoy about smoking it's a social aspect and you enjoyed in a house with your depression but also there's the opposite side where you can't spend as much time with your niece as you want to expect your health it's expensive there seems to be a lot of negative things that you described um well how do you feel about that but there's kind of this discrepancy between the two 
C:	um I mean it's a really hard decision but I feel like my house is like the ultimate matter
T:	so I think like that comes first but again I would just be really hard to stop them like you know in this habit well I definitely applaud you for considering it because I know it wasn't something that you claim to come here to talk about and this was on your schedule but it's definitely important to your health and I'm just like to ask you on a scale of  to  with  being not ready to change at all intending but you're ready to change right now right this second where would you lie on that spectrum 
C:	well after listen all those pros and cons i guess i would say around a six or so 
T:	ok so y is  and not a two or three
C:	I guess it made me step back and kind of realize that I might be following the same lifestyles my dad I could probably end up dead like him from lung cancer and I mean one of my made things that I enjoy like in life is watching my knee so I feel like it would be best for me to style 
T:	so why a six and not and eight or nine
C:	how do I haven't really thought about that much before so I feel like it will take a little time for me to get there but her dad it's just breaking the habit will probably be the most of calls 
T:	so six is a great start and I definitely think that that's something that we can work with together on do you know of any thing that will help you quit smoking? 
C:	um I guess I could hang out with another different group of friends or just maybe kind of stay back if they're smoking and try to find something else to do I could also maybe do something to like exercise to kind of get my mind off smoking or do something they'll be beneficial to my health 
T:	yeah so exercising did different group of friends that maybe isn't it revolved around smoking with that there's also group therapy that I know you do for your depression which is also awesome to help people stop smoking and we can give you some pamphlets and give you a number that we can set you up with have you ever considered nicotine patches 
C:	um no I haven't really thought about it but now that you mention a hug I'll probably look into it 
T:	okay so let's get you the number and we can discuss the nicotine patches are an alternative for you that would work we can schedule an appointment or in the next two or three weeks and see the progress that you've made and I really am glad that we had this conversation and it seems like you're readily ready to quit so that's awesome 
C:	yeah thanks for talking to me
T:	yeah of course
