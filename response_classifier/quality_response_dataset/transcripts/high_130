C:	yes 
T:	ok so here you scored a  which is in the category of risky use so for a women year a woman your age drinks per week  and then drinks per day  so she's going to go ahead and discuss a few things to ask you a couple questions um so what about drinking do you like 
C:	it helps me sleep at night and it calms me when I have like a long day at school 
T:	okay and then but what do you like about what do you dislike about drinking 
C:	um it's very expensive after a while when you continually five bottles of wine or bottles of alcohol in order to go to sleep at night time or to even just filled levels throughout the day 
T:	okay so basically what you're saying is that we're drinking alcohol you like that it helps you sleep and it calms you in the way you did talk about alcohol that it's very expensive except what you're saying
C:	yes I go through about thirty to fifty dollars every three days
T:	okay okay um so if it's okay with you on a scale from  to  with  being not really not ready at all until being very ready how ready are you to cut back on to cut back your drinking or to quit drinking so from a scale of  to  how ready are you 
C:	three 
T:	okay um so Wyatt three and not of five or six 
C:	um I just like the way it feels i don't know if i get bored I just it's just easy to just grab my fridge and just get a bottle of wine or something it's gotten become very habitual now 
T:	okay um so what negative things had happened to you while you've been drinking 
C:	um I may send a lot kind of misleading text messages or I may have called my mom puppet on flawless drunk just to like let her know like I was drinking in that you know I kind of put in a little either intoxicated or something so I've sent a flow of calls and text messages to family members that let them know that I drink 
T:	okay so what you're saying is that then by eating 'king it's led to you sending risky text messages and just better to see a family into your friends that you wouldn't really send if you were sober correct 
C:	yes
T:	okay so um I'm concerned about how you're drinking and how may be affecting your health so is it okay if I follow up with you about this on your next visit
