T:	oh hello how are you doing today 
C:	i member you good 
T:	so i received the email referral from your school on your university housing office contacted me but incident you had providing alcohol I'm really glad to see you here a lot of regular referrals from what doctors offices counselors and schools of this and a lot of people are a little hesitant at first step it's a little scary so I wanna commend you for coming in here taking that first step it's awesome so what brings you today 
C:	well I've had alcohol in my room a few times and my roommate miss whole University I think on me so I've had a couple meetings with them and I guess they got since it was so many times and it's still occurring that maybe I had a problem and needs chopped someone about it 
T:	okay how many times have you seen your housing staff 
C:	with all the zone probably about three times stop their job yeah cuz every time they moan referred to by your living yes it has um maybe my roommate used to be pretty close and then I lost my brother recently and I'm kind of abusing alcohol to do with that and I don't feel like she understands that like she's tried she tried to be there for me in the beginning like you know friends are but I kind of push her away because she doesn't understand that they are all bringing ski of pain that feel however that I was pretty close
T:	I'm very sorry to hear about your loss um I know it's hard to lose someone you love and so you might be using alcohol is  means to go with that how the right time processing your feelings 
C:	I am and because of that I kind of stopped going to class so I think that's another reason that line / my mom really loves before we were this is my second year at school and we became friends last ready to ring together this year and things are going great in the beginning we had this core group of friends and that we would go out on the weekend and we wouldn't let it affect anything and then after all my brother I have just went downhill from there and alcohol just became like I said it hope you mechanism to help me deal with it the pain of that loss and I think that is surely 
T:	okay so human using alcohols it means to go with your brother and I hear that you have been missing class how often will probably come to me to say to use this class and I Prime Minister's very kind to me so I'm sure that's a little bit of stress for you 
C:	oh yeah I pay for college of my own um and without going to class my grades if I'd fallen and I do get a scholarship that helped me a little bit and if my great fall below a certain GPA and I lose that scholarship and redundant we're getting close so that definitely add some stress
T:	okay well first good job for you for paying for school on your own that's really tough I know it's really expensive so that's great and it's good thing that you're working towards education here here you trying you know it's hard to do loss so maybe you could just think of some other ways that you can like cook what the lungs how would you say the typical an eye out with your practicing 
C:	um well i usually get up around noon and then i'll go to lunch with some of my friends and then i'll come back and take a nap because I thing out really late that I'm four and then I'll get up and shower and get ready there's an eye out although out about nine o'clock sometimes they even go along because my friends don't want to go with me so weak they also three or four blocks and then I six through my alarm in the morning and don't make it class so I don't miss coughing purpose it's just as I through my alarm and then don't get up until around noon if I then x-men suppose my closet so there's no point really going to the other one so so then I knew it all over him right which I mean I understand your chums loves and scene and you have a lot one on 
T:	it sounds like with lots of your brother and have fingers on your own and trying to maintain a good GPA with class through other ways have you seen alcohol negatively affect early 
C:	well I've lost a few other friends besides just my roommate I have kind of a new corporate group that some of the ones that I went out with my remaining a curly around anymore away as well because they don't under they also don't understand the drinking so a lot of lost friendships obviously my braids in my GPA and also with paying for school I just have a job on campus and I don't make much money um and right now all that money is going towards to alcohol that apply so financial stress is definitely a big one
T:	so you can have a gift straight to your using alcohol to see if the stress so you can think of watching your own but not all can be pretty expensive 
C:	yeah it's a definitely is expensive for ages
T:	um ok so maybe we can think of some ways that you can be stressed without alcohol um can you think of any ways that you could do that?
C:	um well I really like working out so I think going to the gym could help a little bit and reading I kind of like it often books and I haven't really used that as a way to cope with this because being with a thing that me and my brother kind of just gathered but I'm going to a point where I think that maybe i can start reading me Danny get less than that is going out I do enjoy i do think i might so go out with my friends on weekends and that's something that i can start doing with my roommate again I just don't want it to that or to become a problem like it had with my forwardness
T:	right maybe so maybe when you go out and friends you can find a way to control your is those pom-poms images 
C:	yes and I can also talk to them about what okay
T:	well I really think your idea of working out it's a great one I know that a lot of my other clients have tried it it seems great results not only will it help me destress and but it will all be like you happy release some endorphins Fauria and i'll keep you fit so that will probably want me to shreds  C;	yeah I hope 
T:	so great so you refer to me by your university housing office right off of all infraction	um you've been dealing with the loss of your brother and financial stress of school and worry about your friends so would you like ot take a few steps to take control of your key? 
C:	I definitely think that I need to take some such source control me 
T:	great so in what ways would you like to do that 
C:	um well I think definitely the two other things that I've talked about helping me to deal with stress and then I think just coming out things especially like if I slip up and go out and in this class I think besides I want to talk to you about that i think would help and then sing maybe you every two weeks or something great talk about 
T:	I think that's a great plan so would you like to maybe schedule an appointment for the twisting company and there's great selfie right I will see you then Kelly
C:	thank you so much i have a great day
