T:	hello kelsey thank you for coming in today I'm Shelley see our own personal trainers I shall be through you um so why are you here today there's some behaviors you want to change anything that you want to take care of
C:	yeah I'm here because I would like stop eating so much sugar primarily in the form of candy
T:	okay
C:	as I work out a lot i would say high intensities and I just feel like I'm always striving for this healthy lifestyle but then I will eat soon so girls in one sitting and it kind of ruins everything that I'm working toward
T:	all right so um what are some pros and cons to eating candy
C:	well pros aren't that is delicious
T:	it is
C:	and cons obviously it's not good for anything down the road I don't want to make it a habit because I honestly don't want to develop any chronic diseases or um it enables me to not lose weight even though it's not really goal but kind of always the goal um it doesn't make me feel good afterward that's for sure
T:	what was that
C:	is enjoyable in the moment
T:	alright so what I hear you saying is that you really enjoy how can you taste and it makes you feel good at the moment I'm assuming because you're getting the pleasure oh you can't be um but afterwards you just you don't like the way that makes your body feel you feel bogged down and gross and then potentially see the side effects of maybe unwanted weight gain and things that you're striving to prevent
C:	yeah that's exactly
T:	okay so on a scale of 0 to 10 how much do you think you can make the change to quit eating candy
C:	well this has been a repeated effort for me so I'm going to say about a 7 because I feel like I can do it but I work around a lot of candy there's candy on my desk so it's kind of hard to resist
T:	okay well it's not a zero so you have some confidence in yours
C:	yeah
T:	all right um so when you say that you have candy at work is there any way you can get rid of that
C:	now because I work for an athletic director and the can use for the athletes post bay but
T:	sometimes just thank you know the cookies over or katie jo should i say all right so what are your goals how do you see yourself quitting in canyons
C:	well i would like to start making like a foo dog and not lying to myself about how much candy i'm actually eating when i eat 32 the rules i should write down that I didn't
T:	all right that's started
C:	you know maybe check that for six weeks and see if actually looking at how much candy I meeting will help me realize that it's
T:	okay good good so what are you saying correct me if I'm wrong is you think that logging your sugar intake is going to help you see on top of the way you feel after you eat candy how much can you you're actually eating
C:	right yeah I'm going with that do i can write down you know how much i sleep or what else i'm eating and see if the g3 some candy helps with other
T:	okay
C:	lifestyle factors
T:	good good i understand that it's really hard quitting kidding i myself have been known in the past you eat a ton of canyon or the city right right this or can you explain me again just some more reasons why you think it's going to be hard and why you think you can do it
C:	well i think it's gonna be hard because i work every day but monday that it's on my chest tuesday and thursday i work in the morning so it's less likely for me to snack on it i don't really know why i just don't think about it in the morning and i'm only there for three hours so that would definitely be a reason why i would have a hard time resisting it but this this last week I've been putting up signs from the candies door that says no candy all right Pizza sticky
T:	okay no good that's a good story
C:	always help quick
T:	and can you clarify for me one more time the kind of pleasure you get from eating candy
C:	well obviously taste I'm sure it stimulates some sort of happy memories
T:	okay
C:	um you know how we Easter Christmas is all about the candy
T:	yeah so what you're saying is that candy brings back good memories and it tastes good and it makes you happy but at the same time it frustrates you and you're having a hard time letting it go because of work I mean it's hard to get rid of things when they're so prevalent in your life and candy is everywhere we look
C:	but strong
T:	so I would just like to understand a little bit more on how you're going to put definite goals I'd like to write down four goals for you on how we want to derail your need for handy
C:	okay well so the first one I'm going to do is log my I think I'm gonna log all night and day
T:	okay
C:	including candy
T:	good
C:	and fruit could probably be it would be a definite factor in that as well um secondly I'm going to continue to put up those post-it notes in front of the candy jar saying that I should not eat candy network
T:	okay
C:	um thirdly I have a Fitbit and I was thinking about writing like no sugar really small bed in it you know just as a reminder just when I think that nicca now probably shouldn't what do you have any suggestions about what
T:	have you ever considered maybe talking to your boss I'll moving the candy jar from the table to maybe an instant table next to the door or something so it's out of reach
C:	right every two no I haven't but that's a good idea or even talk to him about so Jana with fruit or really anything else besides candy
T:	because really i mean its athletes we're working with you and athlete like yourself
C:	i'll be passing out candy
T:	should not be eating candy do i think that you can maybe make a push and get some gratification for yourself out of improving the lives of others one for being your own
C:	I think that a very good idea
T:	ok so you're really willing to make this change apparently
C:	yes I want to make this change
T:	ok um and you've already started you started with the post-it notes um my only other suggestion if you don't mind me giving you a suggestion
C:	how about that um
T:	would be like you said with the fruit consider all of the food you're taking in because sometimes after you exercise your body crave sugar because you're not getting enough complex car such as like bread or rice or something like that before you workout so your blood Sugar's just dropping so just monitor the way you feel more than just the pleasure since you get from the delicious
C:	yeah all right
T:	do you have any questions
C:	no I think that we've caught with a really good plan here and I'm excited to give it a go this week
T:	all right well I'm excited for you so I'll will take a look at the log and we'll reevaluate these goals here in about two weeks and we'll see how the candy is going hopefully your boss will work with you some
C:	okay
T:	all right well thank you
C:	thank you
T:	good day
C:	good
