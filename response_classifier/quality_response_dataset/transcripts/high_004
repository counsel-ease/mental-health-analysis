C:	Welbeck I'm just not sure that I'm ready to quit I just I just don't think I can do this right now
T:	so you're really not confident that you'd be successful long-term
C:	yeah pretty much
T:	you know like I know quitting is really hard and it takes a lot of strength to go through that but is it the hardest thing you've ever done
C:	what must be because I haven't quite yet
T:	well in all seriousness is I know there's other hard things you've been through so if quitting really the toughest thing you've ever done
C:	no I'm Courtney I mean going to my divorce was difficult
T:	and you got through it
C:	yeah but there was just different circumstances
T:	it is a different type of difficulty you're right and I don't want to make light of that but what I'm the point I'm trying to make with you is that it was difficult and you rose to the challenge and you got through it
C:	yeah that's true
T:	so what I know of you is that when you're faced with a tough challenge like a divorce you rise to the occasion and you manage to get through it and you come out on top so are you ready for the challenge of quitting
C:	yeah you know I hear what you're saying but you know I just don't want to be a failure I don't want to let people down I don't want to let my family down and I I just don't think I'm ready
T:	well I do totally respect your decision if you really don't want to quit and you're not open to it then you know that is your choice whatever you choose to do about your smoking habit really is your choice and I do respect that so where do we go from here
C:	well I don't want to quit right now but I know that in the past cutting down has helped me
T:	cutting down that would be a great step I mean that would be wonderful so I know you've tried before what else have you learned what other lessons have you learned from quitting I'm guessing you've learned a lot of lessons
C:	well I know in the past the nicotine gum has helped me I just didn't really care for the taste
T:	well I have some ideas on that if you'd be open to hearing them
C:	sure
T:	they've got a lot of new flavors on the gum they're cinnamon and orange and juicy fruit which is a popular one and mint and I've had a lot of people have favorable things to say about the new flavors
C:	that's something I didn't know that so you think you might want to try it again again in addition to cutting back
T:	how about if I cut back for a month and then I'll try the gum
C:	I think that is an excellent idea and I think that you really will be able to do it this time
T:	I also
