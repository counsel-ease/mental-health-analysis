T:	okay Tamra so I just finished reevaluate your gums
C:	yeah
T:	and we did your scaling and root planing just a few weeks ago
C:	uh-huh
T:	and I wanted to let you know that we didn't get the response that we were looking for
C:	Oh No
T:	so I wanted to ask you on a scale from one to ten ten being the best on being the worst how important is it to you
C:	about four or five
T:	okay what do you think it would take to move you to a seven or an eight
C:	maybe some more information because you know I'm newly diabetic so I'm just learning you know my diet and taking my medicine and stuff and sometimes I forget to take my medicine but you know maybe if you could help me with that
T:	okay so tell me what you know about the relationship between diabetes and gum disease
C:	I know that it you know it kind of goes together but I'm not really sure anything else about it
T:	that's true that's true that's good the relationship between your gums and your diabetes if your diabetes is not well controlled it's not it's not a good thing your gums tissues tend to be more irritated they believe much more easily your gum disease progresses much quicker and how long has it been since you've seen your doctor
C:	my Sultan last week and he took like work and then he called me back and he said that my number was like 7.5 and it's not really where he wanted me to be at but he said since I was so new that you know I just still needed to work on my diet and taking the medicine we need to give it a little bit longer and see if that won't help
T:	okay good sounds like you're really motivated and you're doing some research and kind of staying on top of it that's you know trying
C:	I'm trying to get the diet down
T:	good
C:	that's a little bit different
T:	good what would you say is your biggest challenge for keeping it well controlled
C:	I'm probably taking my medicine because I forget a lot of times you know I just I don't really take any other medicines and that's the you know and I need to take it every day he said so sometimes I do forget so that that could be it
T:	okay well I have a couple of suggestions and I think what help is that okay
C:	yeah
T:	okay the first thing I think would be a good idea would be that you put your medication near your toothbrush
C:	that would work yeah because you're taking it at night
T:	right right
C:	and it's metformin
T:	right
C:	okay so if you put your toothbrush and your medication side by side then you would be brushing your teeth at night before you go to bed which is very important yes and then you can take your medication and you'd be less likely to forget
T:	that's right that would I mean that would work
C:	okay good so now tell me with the information I've given you today how would you say what would you say be a 1 or a 10 in regards to taking better care of your gums where would you be
T:	I don't probably I need to be you know more like a seven or eight because it is really affecting you know my cleaning and everything if I don't take my medicine and don't you know get my diabetes under control
C:	well good I think we have a plan and I think we're gonna see better results next thank you
