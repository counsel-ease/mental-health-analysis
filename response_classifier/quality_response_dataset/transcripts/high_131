T:	okay so let's review some of the things we talked about last week um what were some of the reasons why you came in 
C:	well I'm having some really bad trouble with my time management skills and not being able to stay focused 
T:	okay and we talked about a few solutions like working on your time management skills and I did suggest that you go see a doctor about the possibility of having a DD and we did talk about the possibility of you enrolling in the u.s. I counseling center so have you thought any more about those options 
C:	it could be a good possibility I could try that out it can always be for the better 
T:	okay and so I ask you to think about the pros and cons so what are some of those that you came up with 
C:	well some of the cons to it it's going to be you know part of my time my name is a factor mm-hmm like with a doctor since I do not have insurance
T:	okay so taking out time out of your day and the money are obviously some big concerns that maybe we can look into you and we're gone but what would be some positives of doing that 
C:	oh it would be the outcome with it for the positive part would be tremendous like I would be able to with 
T:	the Counseling Center they provide a service or you're able to
C:	since I do lose focus a lot I'm allowed to take my test in a controlled environment with only by myself and I get extra time you name it enables me to have better focus all around 
T:	okay so um now while those are obviously some things that would help you what are some things may be stopping you from doing those already because clearly you know that those are things that are available to you but what stopped you up until now
C:	well with the Counseling Center was taught me was having to have a written agreement and approval from a outside doctor okay but also some other positive aspects of like you know trying to take care of the th ed problems and my time management skills some positive outcomes of those would be being able to function throughout my day besides just you know my test and the Counseling Center 
T:	okay so they would help improve really socially socially and a work as well because we didn't talk about some more issues that came up throat okay um now what are some positive attributes that maybe you think you already have that can help you make these changes now what are some things about you that make you think you can definitely do this 
C:	oh um I'm a go-getter if I know something and I'm strive enough to do it I'll do it
T:	okay 
C:	give me a few more let's see here um I make sure when I start something I make sure I finish it 
T:	okay well I don't ever try to leave any things left undone ok so maybe thinking about those maybe we can apply those to you no more ways to motivate you to make those changes and get towards your solutions 
C:	okay great
