T:	well cast our walls I'm really glad that you were able to find some time to actually get get together
C:	well it's good to see you're finally where you been
T:	yeah that's right I know I was thrilled to see that you've made an appointment on my calendar and you know you have this benefit as a health coach and we've just never been able to find time to get together I know you're always running around helping someone someone or whoever I hear about that raving about pastor wall it's great help
C:	well I've got people that try to fit into the schedule to meet him for breakfast or lunch and around the work schedule and that keeps me occupied and trying to fit the schedule is
T:	sounds like you're really running 24 7
C:	or 7 24
T:	that's happily so blonde glad that you took the time out to you know think a little bit about yourself and spend a little time that we could talk about how things are going for you you know you give a lot of your time to everyone else but it's also good for you too you have some balance and think about things for yourself also
C:	is it really sounds like it so that's great that you decided to come in well thank you for letting me come you okay
T:	so tell me about how things are going over overall I know you had mentioned in your email that you lost some weight recently
C:	yeah dead wife quit feeding me know
T:	your wife's foot feeding you huh well I'm sure if you quit feeding you you would find some other great way to eat
C:	but that's all good little exercise helps on that and splitting meals sure meals instead of eating that big portion that the restroom gives you you know we split it that works
T:	so you thought you've really found that when you want to eat you both order wasn't one portion and share it
C:	most of the time
T:	okay so that and then adding more exercise
C:	more exercise yep
T:	that's what seems to have worked for you
C:	yeah exercise helps
T:	well what kind of exercise do you like to do I mean you probably get enough exercise just running around between folks
C:	well I do that but you know I roll out of bed then I run around the block three ties then it kicked the block under the bed and go back to bed
T:	you do do you have to go for that early morning block block and monitor the neighborhood
C:	bicycle League works
T:	basically
C:	yeah that works um
T:	how did you get into that
C:	had a bike there and that's a good place to ride so that's easy to do
T:	ok
C:	easy to do and
T:	sounds like something you enjoy
C:	yeah yep good check out the neighbors see what they're doing is why they're really awesome right
T:	then everyone's waving down pastor Walt with their
C:	30
T:	latest thing that they're not talk to you about oh good well if there was anything about your health you're still thinking about now in terms of you know what's your next goal or what your next step or something you're thinking about
C:	mm not really that I know about
T:	so overall things seem to be going pretty special you are you
C:	things are good
T:	yeah so that's that's that's awesome it sounds like good a great place and sounds like the things you have implemented
C:	their works
T:	and working really well
C:	it works
T:	well on this scale of one to ten you know like we use that pain scale with people as nurses how confident are you that you'll continue on with what you've been doing as far as the portions and though bike riding
C:	Oh probably seven
T:	is that a seven or an eight
C:	sure
T:	so pretty confident that things will continue on it you can maintain what you've been doing and that's great you're not a zero
C:	well yeah like Cyril
T:	well what makes you a seven and not a four in terms of confidence
C:	I guess that's just the way I am is just tough and it can be done in maybe do it
T:	well because you've been doing it and you've been consistent and successful with it
C:	correct
T:	and what would it take to make you be a nine in terms of being more confident that it'll happen all the time
C:	oh just another couple days on the bike a couple days out good
T:	so what I'm hearing you say is that's kind of what you're wanting to get to is being able to global add a little more to what your schedule is and how do you see yourself doing that
C:	well that's the child because if you go to meet people for breakfast at seven thirty eight o'clock
T:	Wow 730 a clumsy
C:	and try to ride a bike before and shower and stuff ahead
T:	that means you're getting up pretty early
C:	so you do it in the afternoon what a ton of degrees no that doesn't work either so evenings maybe
T:	okay so of course the Florida whether you've got those hundred degree humid temperatures where you feel like you're hot then you get on the bike
C:	right
T:	island by the evening is it is it cool down some and we committed to taking off a little need me
C:	on the rare occasion all day
T:	huh so that it's kind of picking those days of window I feel like going out there do I feel like sweating right now on the bike
C:	that's it
T:	uh-huh so that seems kind of like your next focus on just trying to implement that
C:	yeah a little more be good but
T:	well it sounds like you know you're doing a lot to really think about your house and to have a balance between what you're offering to other people but also taking time for you do you do anything just do do anything just for you time just to you know be able to just have your own time to enjoy and mind
C:	like grab a good book
T:	mmhmm
C:	yeah
T:	grab a good book that's always a great way to
C:	personal leadership
T:	uh-huh
C:	looks
T:	and you find that that gives you
C:	what yeah not one of those fluffy novel things
T:	none of the fluffy Harlequins or whatever that the women like to watch read huh
C:	yeah note those
T:	leadership something that gives you some more tools to work with folks that have some depth to them well that sounds great if we could just perhaps maybe talking you know a couple maybe four to six weeks and kind of see how that bicycling is going for you and just know I'm here for you and
C:	that's good so you're going to be here
T:	yeah I'd love to continue to be your support
