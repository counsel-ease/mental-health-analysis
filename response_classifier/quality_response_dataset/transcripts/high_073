T:	you know not sure how they're really tracking
C:	exactly and it was really hard for me to get the kids ready for school to get ready for work and I was late for work and and my boss was for the mad but

T:	she talked about that
C:	yeah I was coming out of the library and was downtown and I was headed to my car and it was late and the sky he just came out of nowhere and you know he's really rough language and he grabbed my pocketbook and then he took off and it was really it was really really upsetting there was a policeman nearby and you know they found the guy you know he's he's wouldn't jail but I got my pocketbook back and but it was horrible
T:	I'm so scary
C:	it was really bad yeah yeah maybe that was what I mean it was it was after that that I started hearing my name
