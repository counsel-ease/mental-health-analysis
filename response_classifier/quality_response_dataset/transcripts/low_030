T:	good morning is really nice that you've come along to see me to talk about stopping smoking what have you got in mind what you want from us
C:	well I need some medication if you can offer me some
T:	absolutely when the right place for that
C:	and whatever else you can do just to get me to go smoke-free
T:	okay what just remind me in why is you want to stop
C:	it's just these days I'm finding that I'm smoking 20 30 a day of getting sick of it in certain I've seen my friends have stopped smoking too and it's kind of looking at me weird these days like I'm the only one left who's still smoking
T:	good and severe depression here
C:	especially the other night I was at the restaurant it's been embarrassing on the only walk walking out
T:	so that can't feel like I'm comfortable being myself so that sounds like one of the reasons you have to quit is it's all getting smelly and it's getting see any other reasons um
C:	it's expensive these days it's actually cause to believe this about our buyer go through pack a day so it's almost seven pounds
T:	seven pounds a week or
C:	seven pounds a day today
T:	forty
C:	fifty
T:	could really quit we even my math you see okay so we're talking about spec fifty couldn't we being one of the few left smoggy in your crowd and not liking the smell that sounds like three reasons do you think that's enough to make you say goodbye to cigarettes eight okay so have you got a date in mind when you like to stop smoking
C:	what you do what do you suggest
T:	generally it works well if you find a time when you're not under a huge amount of other stresses and strains one of the main reasons why you actually smoke what you enjoy most about
C:	it's just something when I bought it oh my god I smoke or something I go out as I said I'm the only one kind of outside thank you
T:	do you think you'll be supposed about the
T:	sort of stresses
C:	just when I go down after a break at work I go down I just need break away from it all just a shelf so I really enjoyed that the cigarette just helps me calm down
T:	does your favorite cigarette the day
C:	it's definitely the one at the end of evening
T:	at the end of the day I think that helps you just online put an end to the work section and move into your own time
C:	yeah
T:	okay so after you've had the quit date what do you think you might do when is the first day at work it's time if you're not gonna cigarette
C:	I guess I'll just I'll just have some fresh air as well but this time without a cigarette in my hand to try and give myself regular breaks one of those tough things
T:	how do you manage to stop sneaking in the past
C:	I've managed for a couple of weeks and
T:	what got you back it was
C:	to be honest is stress an argument with my partner
T:	remember it says I make just how many I sort of took you back into right let me just make sure I've understood what's going on here you really want to sort of thinking with this we kind of the last guy in your group still smoking it costs a lot of money and you don't be like smell the main reason that you smoke is because at the end of the day gives you the kind of relaxation and there's quite a little stress is going on which you're using cigarettes to help you cope with what you like to do is stop and you'd like to sort of choose a time to quit when it's going to be there's not as much stress around as possible when do you think would be a good time for you to choose to being your quit date okay
C:	so the weekend I've got a party coming up so maybe Monday morning
T:	Monday morning after party really good day that's next week okay now one of the things that we do the pharmacy is recommended medication to help you know this increases your chance of success and it makes it more likely come along a lot of people make using nicotine replacement therapy which comes in a variety of formats like patches gum you probably seen people using any of these products and other options are tablets which you can get from the GP local champion again so have you something in mind that you might like to use to help you through managing the cravings
C:	I'm thinking one of these patches
T:	okay so patches I think you've already seen them again I'll get some out and I'll show you what they look like this course of medication lasts for ten to twelve weeks and we strongly recommend that we will stay on the whole course of medication and that that gives you the best chance of success stopping smoking is not easy but it's and when the type of support we offer here in the pharmacy you absolutely make your chance of success for x greater than try on your own so that's why it's really good that you come to see me you said that you really want to do it and then next week sounds like a good day for you to start because the party's opened up with you've got the time at the end of the day when you finish work which might be the first time you've gone without a cigarette so what I like to recommend is that you use two products perhaps and I'm thinking of you having a patch and then suggesting that you might use something that you can top up with often a person who smokes that's exactly what it feels like when they're craving for cigarette what does it feel like to you thing that you want one
C:	it's just like a irritable
T:	okay and that's exactly one of the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that I'm looking to stop happen to you so I would strongly recommend that you have the patch talk about how to use it and that we have another product that I leave you to use as when any of those feelings of irritation coming out that typically in that first week so you're happy with the date for me okay would you like to come back and see me again other and what would you like me to do if you don't come back
C:	nice Frank
