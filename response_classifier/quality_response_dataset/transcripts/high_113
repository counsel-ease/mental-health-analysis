T:	yes and have you been lately I haven't seen you in a while yeah I mean I've been 
C:	ok oh I've been really busy with school and stuff and like it's just been really stressful if you know I was like the last couple weeks in April it's just there's so much going on like I just I don't know I need a drink 
T:	what do you mean when you say you want me to drink like you just let you drag often or it can I ask you about this sir 
C:	yeah it's I mean it's cool I don't know just like ever since I turned  I've been going out a lot and like I just love it I don't know like I drink like I pretty much only on the weekends I try to keep this weekend's 
T:	so it sounds like you're saying that um you drink too kind of forget about school and like forget about you know school ending and moving home get some food or summer and everything like that 
C:	yeah i mean i only drink like thursday friday saturday and sunday so like I guess it doesn't really like do a lot of school but no I mean it's think I've does like I'm really stressed like sometimes I just want to get my mind off of things like I have so much on my mind right now I'm so busy with everything like with school and like my family like my brother's coming here next year and it's just like freaking me out like I'm so stressed with everything I just I don't know how to deal with it without drinking 
T:	hmm um do you do you see like a problem with three king or do you do you think that like do you like does it make you feeling good or bad or like what kind of like effects does it get do to you?
C:	I mean I don't really see a huge problem with it like I know that it's probably not good for grades and stuff but like when I go to the bar I feel like wonderful like you should see it like there are so many guys that hit on me like I get so many free drinks and I just love it like I feel like I'm so like I don't know like I feel hot like I feel attractive and like me and my boyfriend go to the bar all the time so like I feel like he likes me better when I'm late I don't know like I just I gotta feel free I'm there like whenever I go out I guess it's just alcohol 
T:	well well you said earlier that um you know your grades weren't where you want them when you're gonna go stressed out about it um do you think that like alcohol is kind of having a negative effect on that?
C:	I mean I guess if you say it that way yeah like when I came into school like when I came here I have four point oh straight out high school I mean like I have a lot of scholarships and stuff and just since ever like I when I turned  I like Lhasa on my scholarships like my gpas like I'm not looks kind of Dara Singh good it's like a  like it went out a lot like last semester and this semester hasn't been much better like like I got kicked out of the Honors College like I don't know I'm on academic probation I don't really like to talk about it I mean it's a little embarrassing but at the same time like drinking just it makes me forget all of it like that's just added stress from school and I'd rather just relieved it with alcohol icic 
T:	you're saying um you also mentioned that you know you go to the bar with your boyfriend a lot do you think that there's any alternative things you guys can do together like possibly like go to the library and son together or you know just kind of have like i annoy you to stay in on the weekends instead of going out 
C:	I mean yeah I guess we could we could do that we could study but drinking just makes me feel so good and like I know he loves it like he always wants to go out with me too so I feel like we just have a better time together in our relationship is stronger over jerking like I mean okay we do fight a lot when I get drunk and I get like a little bit jealous but it's worth it 
T:	um do you think that there's any changes you would want to make with your drinking or you content with like just drinking you know four days a week every weekend?
C:	I mean I don't really want to change like I love drinking I I know it's not good for grades and like and really for relationships but like i just love it like it's my relationship with drinking like it i like jerking thursday or sunday and like sometimes my weeks are so stressful like I have three jobs I go to school I have a boyfriend and like I just need a drink during the day sometimes 
T:	um how does drinking affect your morals like you like is this I mean if can I ask you like does this run your family or is it something you know that your parents like do and you think is okay or like how does that work 
C:	I mean no I've never been like any alcoholism or anything in my family like I've never really even seen that like in my life so I guess it's it's I don't know um I just I don't know I feel like it's not a huge problem
T:	um you said that you know you weren't raised like that you're do parents do you think your parents would like if they knew you drank this much?
C:	to me that they would like it and support it or no I would never tell my parents I drink this much like I know you like asking about my morals and stuff like when I was little like my parents raised me like super conservative like I was never allowed to like hang out with the boys and like I always had to like dress appropriately and like do everything but like when I drink like I can do whatever I want like I love it like I mean yeah my girls kind of go down the drain my guy use aren't really there anymore but like I don't know it's alcoholic I just feel it feel great but people think I'm great it's just I feel excited 
T:	um do you think you've used to lived at home when your parents thinking about this like it's something with their degree precautions like you'd be kicked out or baby Madi you?
C:	yeah I mean honestly like I probably try to hide it from my parents but if they ever found out they wouldn't let me say there there's no way
T:	um so on a scale of one to ten how likely do you think you could like make this change if you're willing to?
C:	of course probably like a for like maybe of five but like honestly right now I don't think I need to make a change like I don't know I just I feel like my life is fine like i'll work on my grades grades are important but i'll graduate eventually like I just I don't know right now like I'm in college when I have a good time like I want a drink well that's great on these a year to four or five and not it is zero or one because 
T:	it sounds like you're definitely some what motivated to you know getting to getting to you know improve drinking have you ever considered possibly drinking me they like once on the weekend instead of like four times or maybe even limiting to like two or three let me just something like that four times a week ?
C:	yeah I thought about it but like I guess I've never really had a reason to do that like my life is fine like I can focus on stuff with alcohol sometimes alcohol makes me study better like I think that right now I'm locator I'm at eventually I guess I could work anyway down but i mean i'll probably grow out of it or anything 
T:	so it sounds like you're saying that alcohol brings pot of both positive and negative aspects to your life um what do you think that there's more of more positive or negative 
C:	honestly like probably more positive I mean like I said like like I feel better about myself I look better like in my own eyes I know my boyfriend likes it better unlike he's drunk and when i'm joined together like ever met the bar who buys me drinks like I just I feel so much better about like everything in my life 
T:	um have ou think about the counseling center here in the university?
C:	I don't feel like know anything about it 
T:	or if you're talking like an advisor about like your grades and they've ever like and you said you lost your scholarships?
C:	yeah i mean like last semesters the first mr. I've ever like go to an advisor I always kept them on my own and I went to the Assizes they like weren't happy at all they told me he's like step it off and get my great together I need to work harder in all my classes and I was going to be in forever and I'm just like you know what like I don't know what I do need to work with my great-aunts bullet I mean I didn't know 
T:	you could like talk to them about like other stuff like you could talk to them about alcohol um I mean I'm sure that if you had I'm like that like and if they couldn't answer your question necessarily probably would direct you to someone who like could like maybe like a psychologist or someone on campus like a counselor like I said before effort has a Counseling Center where you know you can just go in and talk to someone who you know it was more about like alcohol like people that drink and stuff like that and like how to handle your problems if you're interested I I do have a number but it up to you know 
C:	I mean yeah i guess i'd appreciate that like i mean nothing has really happened so far making change with my ways but i guess i could take the number 
T:	um what you said so you said that you're like a  what do you think it would take for you to get on like a nine or  look what do you think would really change your views on this 
C:	I mean like probably my brother like i tol she's coming here next year and like he means the world to me and like honestly like if something ever happened to him because of alcohol like I would stop like the cold turkey I would have to because like he's my like everything he's my little brother and like I don't know like back in my hometown like drugs were like a big thing and like a lot of people like with died because of drugs with my best friend's boyfriend died because of drugs in like if something ever happened to my boyfriend because alcohol like I would stop because I've seen it with other things but alcohol just never seemed like a threat to me like it never seemed like it could hurt and once I guess if it did I would give me a reason to like
T:	um have you ever thought that maybe next year my brother does come that a friend that you know the things you do is like it will reflect back on Hamlin kilowatt to start maybe thinking about drinking and you know kind of like following your footsteps if he sees you out at the bars
C:	I mean yeah like when he came here to visit and softly like asked me like if I take it too far and I guess I give the back of my mind I always thought like okay he's  i probably shouldn't take in there but like I took him anyway and it's like I guess if he just like follows in my footsteps and like does everything i do i like would be happy with him like I don't even get in trouble like especially because he's so young like I don't have to think it's okay dit to drink all the time and like not do in school 
T:	so that sounds like you're saying that you can't really think if you're like talking about all this you kind of feel like alcohols brought you to more of a negative aspect of your life now that you're considering like your brother and stuff like you putting aside you know the bars and how you feel and your boyfriend 
C:	I mean yeah now that I kind of like have actually thought about it because I never really thought that ever was a problem like I guess it's true like there are negative effects and there's bad things that are happening my life like I guess could be like a tribute it's alcohol and I don't want that to happen anyone else I don't want that to happen my brother I'm like I don't know I I guess it just makes me feel so good that sometimes like I don't know like when is a good time to stop or like how they know the Counseling Center be like well they really help me like I don't know like a delight
T:	I mean the Counseling Center does offer people it's I mean just it's kind of like what you make of it like if you're willing to kind of go in there and hear what they have to say then a minute there's maybe more advice and probably like statistics that I obviously can't provide um but yeah so if you're will I knew that phone number um but is do Casey yourself improving like do you do you like can you give me an answer as to like how you can improve like do you think you could go down only three days a week at or two or you good for daddy at four?
C:	I mean maybe not right away but I guess eventually like I could go down to like three I don't know about to that seems a little bit drastic but like I guess I can try to cut it out my study or some things that it would just be kind of hard 
T:	well that's great that you say that you can cut back to three because honestly on you know little by little like improvements occur like you know you if you say you can do three now who knows in a couple months maybe come back to two or even one or I mean even if you have to stay at three for a while that's fine too 
C:	yeah I guess I guess maybe it's time to it that's a little bit more 
T:	well I'm really good you came here to talk about your your situation with the alcohol and stuff but I hope that this helped you 
C:	I really did Alicia thanks thank you
