T:	okay so I'm just going to ask you a couple more background questions do you use any tobacco products or smoke cigarettes 
C:	no I would bum cigarettes in college but I was never a smoker 
T:	okay how about in the last year 
C:	no not really anything 
T:	okay and how often do you have a drink containing alcohol 
C:	a few times a week Wednesday's I'll go to a happy hour and have about two or three and then um Thursday's seven seven or eight Friday's probably just a couple glasses of wine with dinner but Saturday's are a bigger night and I would probably have a few drinks before I went to the bar and then have  or  at when when I was out so 
T:	okay so it sounds like you're drinking about four times a week anywhere between three and eight drinks on a given day so maybe around  drinks a week 
C:	I guess it sounds like a lot when you say look at but yeah 
T:	okay do you use any street drugs like any marijuana cocaine heroin
C:	no I I spoke weed in college but just a little bit I wasn't a regular smoker 
T:	do you ever use any prescription medicines that were not prescribed for you or ever use your own prescriptions in a way in which they were not prescribed 
T:	okay so you know as we said before you're drinking it sounds like you're drinking about  drinks a week over the course of a few days and I did want to point out to you that the recommended limit for women is actually no more than seven drinks a week and no more than three on a given day so you're doing more than that right now and when you drink more than this amount it puts you at risk for a number of things 
C:	okay 
T:	things like greater risk of injury damage to different parts of your body just a bunch of different problems and so I'm going to recommend that you cut down to cut down that amount to the recommended limit again that's no more than seven drinks a week and no more than  in a given day do you think you could do that would that be a good goal for you 
C:	that's a lot to change I don't know 
T:	yeah I know that making changes isn't always easy but when you more than what's recommended it creates problems you know you said you hurt your ankle and came out of the bar this time
C:	I mean the stairs were really steep so yeah 
T:	well it's possible you strained your ankle as a result of the alcohol you know it can actually affect your balance and stability so really you know for where you are right now you're drinking a good amount more than what's recommended and you know I want you to be healthy and I don't want to see you coming back in here for something else so I'm really going to recommend that you try to cut down to that amount so do you think you could do that cut down to no more than three drinks in a given day
C:	where are these limits from an older population because I drink just as much as my friends do I mean everybody drinks like I drank I'm not even the biggest drinker in my group so I'm pretty middle of the road 
T:	so it sounds like you know the amount you drink is pretty normal amongst the people you typically drink with but these limits are they're actually recommended for all adults and studies have shown that when you drink more than this it creates a bunch of problems like we talked about so you know why do you think you drink the amount you drink 
C:	I don't know that's what we do is this is how we have fun I guess it is fun
T:	well I think it can still have fun with in these amounts so that's what I'm going to recommend I think this is a really good goal and hopefully we won't see any more injuries
T:	okay so why don't you try that 
C:	okay 
T:	all right thank you so much
