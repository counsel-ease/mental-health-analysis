T:	come in hey doctor hello how are you today?
C:	I'm very well thank you have you seen many repeat prescription and what's up for the real doctor Reducto and that's for my my class cuz I've done with it all of them 
T:	right no no no no what when was the last time you got that prescription from us?
C:	although you few miles back 
T:	yes I'm surprised did you see the local GP?
C:	yeah could be hmm 
T:	you shouldn't have been given a doctor why do you think you need that?
C:	I'm using it for a while this kind of referee well because i've been using rate and it well a little bit wait but it helps i'm not so happy anymore and I kind of think it's a bit more and still lose weight
T:	no no no you can't you you can't get that drug anymore I'm afraid no no you're not having that drug anymore and it's been proven that that drug is not good for you and so I'm very surprised that the look and gave it to you but we're not doing it anymore yes but it's not it's not fine it's not good for your heart it's causing heart problems and it's been proven that it's not the most effective way to lose sweet and what what are you doing about your lifestyle? what are you doing about losing weight? other than depending on tablets?
C:	oh okay and change my cooter died kick both ways however Larry's I kind of working chichester really that's doing a bit more stairs and but doesn't much time for you 
T:	well it's going to take a bit more than that I think and have you thought about planning in advance? if you work you know taking a packed lunch pre planning your meals and turning to healthy options? because really even diet cooks not good for you you should be replacing that with water 
C:	oh yeah we don't get meals we can't have to do it in between and Julie doctor at the hospital we have a good time and we need to kind of just bringing her face yeah lovely often you can to be kind you can't even get food is just like you chocolate or something 
T:	yeah but I roll the other doctors overweight no no so clearly you could be improving your lifestyle you could take a wrap and just have it you know you could make a wrap a healthy wrap and take it and just have it instead of reaching for a bar of chocolate because i'll also affect your blood pressure and your sugar levels so and what I think you should maybe do as maybe just have a maybe do a diet e of your lifestyle because well it's a no popping a pill seems like an easy option but really you're going to have to do the hard work this is only going to come if you get in the right headspace and you start looking at your lifestyle looking at your exercise looking at your eating habits looking at the frequency and your magnet you're eating because if you're running about as a doctor you shouldn't beginning we if you if you've got a busy lifestyle you should be losing weight naturally so you're there must be something in your daily routine that's stopping you so you maybe need to look and see if you're a comfort eater or what what your triggers are for food and and get that sorted but you know I'm afraid drugs are no longer the answer C	I'll just get one half down to the last few months of my job and then 
T:	no I know I you know we would all like a magic wand because it makes life easier but I can't do that it's not worth the risk to your heart I can't I can't do that you just need to take a long hard look at yourself and what you're doing and if you want help with that we do have pamphlets you know have you thought about and you know doing some exercise that you feel more energized 
C:	oh I've not lack of energy around all day that's not a problem it's just really time I'm getting time to do something else moment it's just work asleep I'm afraid mm-hmm not much to be there it's just wreck yeah 
T:	so you need to put some thought into if you is that is your lifestyle you're going to have to put some thought into when you can devote some time to looking after yourself 
C:	I think I'll be able to do as I finish this job but I just need something now mm-hmm because otherwise I can't really afford to buy new clothes and it was it was keeping me kid 
T:	so are you putting on weight or have you been losing the weight?
C:	let's think you can be steady and speak 
T:	so you've not you've not been losing weight with it? C 	that's being okay yeah I probably should put on weight of an that's been using it yeah
T:	so you can't you know it's good that you're standing still but it's not good that you're not losing weight especially if you're on the drugs so clearly the drug wasn't the answer for you and really the only answer for you as its lifestyle changes and you know look at your colleagues and are they what are they eating and adopt some of their policy Asian was there eating on the hoof they must there must be some of your colleagues that are eating healthy options that you could you could take a flask of soup you know I'm soup salads wraps fruit and veg you know that's that's the only way is the hard way but it's the only way yeah 
C:	I can't see me doing that that's a problem it's sleeping where no time to give the shelves no time to do preparation that this just like so happy equals there and if we get time to go to the cantinas you just okay just something don't seem to be very many healthy options and if they're either you be gone by the time we get there 
T:	that's why I think you need to control of it yourself by planning and making sure that you have healthy options available because otherwise you're just going to stay in a vicious cycle and and you know drugs we would all like a drug to me things easy for us but I'm afraid easy it's not the option it's going to be a hard slog but I think I think you'll find that once you start if you get yourself into the right headspace once you start then you will have a sense of achievement and the wheat will start loose it you will start losing the week because if you're that energetic in your job you're obviously doing enough activity so it has to be down to the diet 
C:	is there nothing you can do to help
T:	but why don't you make a diary of everything that you eat? because you might not realize I had you might be grazing and not realizing it so why don't you keep a food diary and come back and see me and two weeks time can you keep a diet have you got k cubed I you for two weeks?
C:	yeah I think I should give it yeah if you 
T:	if you write down everything that you eat and any extra activity other than running a boat in your jobs that you do and we'll look at that and where you now before you go and will we when you come back and then we'll see if you can start making a conscious effort and then we'll maybe set you down with a dietician set you up with an appointment with the dietitian to get some nutritional advice but I think you need to start preparing yourself mentally and to be in the right headspace to make this work for you because if you're not in the right frame of mind if you're doing it grudgingly then you're not going to lose weight
C:	okay thank you
