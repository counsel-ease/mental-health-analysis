T:	okay it's a good morning my name is Jane
C:	yeah I'm Michelle
T:	okay so I'll be regional therapist today and the doctor recently told you the UH pre-diabetes and I wanted to get your reaction to this news so that I can better help you
C:	um well I mean I wasn't really expecting this it really caught me off guard and I know what I eat isn't always the healthiest you know but I didn't think things were this bad I mean my life is pretty hectic so I guess I haven't really been taking care of myself
T:	yeah so you were pretty shocked and I'm sensing it might be quite scared too
C:	yeah I'm a little scared but more worried than anything I mean my career is really important to me and I don't really want my pre-diabetes to set me down and I don't really want to have to take medication I'm absolutely terrified of needles so I don't want to be picking myself all the time and then watching what I eat and counting carbohydrates and everything it just sounds like a whole lot of hassle that I don't have time for it you know
T:	you feel like having diabetes will cause some unfortunate lifestyle changes what I'm hear you say is you don't want your bad health to affect the way to affect your career
C:	mm-hmm basically I guess that's what there's so much of mark that I've kind of forgotten to take care of myself and I guess I'm really she did myself in the foot because that's what's cosmic pre-diabetes you know so you feel like you're just not giving the attention your body really deserves
T:	mm-hmm yeah and I obviously haven't been this way like when I took this job I guess that's when my health started spiraling downwards and I don't know I guess that's when I kind of noticed things were kind of off as far as my health goes so
C:	can you tell me a little bit more about what you do well I'm an ESL teacher so I teach English to foreign students and adults I work in a community center close by but I also spend a lot of my days traveling it's just part of the job so I eat out often and always on ago and it makes following a healthy diet and lifestyle pretty difficult and I mean I know exercise and diet I guess that honestly could work out at the gym at the hotels but they aren't always available you know okay
T:	so you recognize the importance of exercise yeah I do but when I get that free time I just want to veg out you know you don't really want to have to come back and go to the gym you know so that's part of it too
C:	so yeah I think that you should make exercise a part of your life exercise is huge in managing your diabetes if you're overweight it can help you lose weight exercise can also help with your blood sugar and it can also reduce your stress levels
T:	um well I guess I mean it could be a way for me to avoid getting diabetes and yes taking medication
C:	I think yeah I think exercise is the right step for you to stop the progression of your diabetes um so how many days a week do you think you can exercise
T:	um I mean right now I just want to say one because you know when I travel I'm not really sure if there's ever going to be anything available and um I don't know I'd like I don't even like exercise so it would be a big step a big change for me
C:	can you make it a goal to exercise three to four times a week I need you to do it more than just one day
T:	um I mean that might just be a little too much for me honestly I mean maybe when I'm stuck in a hotel and they have a gym I'm just unsure as whether I can commit to doing that much because I mean I don't want to buy a gym membership here because I'm not at home enough to use it and I feel like it would just be a waste of money
C:	and I really think that making exercise important part of your life is
T:	yeah I mean I just I don't know it's it's just difficult for me you know like I said I don't enjoy its begin with so it would be a really big step
C:	I'll tell you what you should do I'll give you the name of my trainer just come in mention my name and he'll take care of you his name is George this is this hot Italian guy he really makes working out a walk in the park so you'll go see him
T:	I mean maybe that I still don't know
C:	this will be great for you I'm being physically active is an essential part in the treatment of diabetes it'll lower your blood sugar body fat your body fat will decrease and you'll really feel so much better
T:	yeah I mean like I said we'll see
C:	well thanks for coming in today I feel very confident about this exercise thing that we'll be successful next time you come in we'll look at the progress you made and it kind of increased the number of times that you're exercising a day
T:	I'll see you next time
C:	okay
T:	bye thank you
C:	T
T:	so good morning my name is Jane yeah I'll be your nutritional therapist today so the doctor had told you recently that you have pre-diabetes and I wanted to get your reaction to this news just so that I can better help you
C:	um Wow I mean I wasn't really expecting any of this at all you need to kind of caught me off guard and I'm still kind of in shock I mean I know what I eat is only the healthiest but I mean my life is pretty hectic so I mean I guess I haven't really been taking care of myself I just didn't think it was that bad you know I had pre-diabetes or anything
T:	so see you were pretty shocked with this news and I'm sensing you might be quite scared too
C:	yeah I mean no worries me quite a bit my career is really important to me and I really don't want dive used to slow me down of course nobody wants to take medication and I am definitely afraid of needles so I mean I don't want to be picky myself all day and I'm an ESL teacher and basically I teach English to foreign students and adults and so I work at a community center close by but I also travel quite a bit which I mean I eat out often just because of that and I don't really get to exercise much because I mean a moment ago and some of these hotels don't really have any gyms or anything in the areas are places where you want to go and run and so I mean following a healthy diet is would be pretty hard and I mean I guess I could maybe work out that some of those gems but you know after a long day honestly all you really want to do is just veg out you know and not really have to go to the gym and you know sweat
T:	yeah so you feel like travel at first the affects your health but you recognize the importance of exercise and diet
C:	yeah I mean I know it's good for you but I absolutely hate exercising I mean I think it's so boring and I just I don't know it's not comfortable and I just I don't like making the time for it you know what my life is so busy it's just the last thing on my list so
T:	but your lack of exercise is a concern to you it sounds like yeah a little bit I mean it does bother me like when I was younger I was much thinner and I exercise all the time not do all these sports and everything so I mean it definitely does concern me a little bit you know that I've gotten so far from that you know
C:	so you mentioned that your bother by the way that you look and you also mention that your diet is less than helpful
T:	yeah like I said I have to eat out often just because I travel a lot and also I am always on the go so I'd like driving somewhere like Panera I love Nara and I usually get like breakfast or lunch there sometimes both I think one of my favorite things is the super little bread bowl and I end up usually eating a majority of the bread ball which I know it's probably not the healthiest thing in the world and of course they give you those other options like the apples in the salad but I mean I like to stick with stuff that I like and I don't know like any of that and I mean I also don't eat too many sweets you know I mean so I think I'm okay you know sometimes I eat fine but when I travel I do like to try all the local restaurants and everything sometimes that is a bakery or - my absolute favorite thing in the world peanut butter and jelly donut I mean if you haven't tried them I'll bring one in for you to try because they're absolutely heaven and my dr. pepper honestly you can't live without my dr. pepper
C:	alright
T:	what keeps me going so okay
C:	so you mentioned there are healthier options available in restaurants that you go
T:	yeah
C:	and you said you don't eat sweets often but you also mention your dr. pepper and I can't help but recognize this huge
T:	yeah
C:	that's on our desk
T:	yeah
C:	I mean CERN is what keeps me going throughout the day I mean obviously the caffeine and then a little bit of sugar kick that it gives me it really helps me get through those really long days you know and I mean I've been drinking these things since I was a teenager so I mean just just second nature it's just have it you know
T:	so soda is that energy boost to help you through the day
C:	mm-hmm and I mean I just stopped by the gas station on the way to work I mean like I don't know it's just stuff it make in the morning you know just have it like I stopping it guess I maybe make it another one you know that mean yeah it's just part of my life you know
T:	okay so we could go in a number of directions here and I wonder which makes the most sense to you um you mentioned exercise possibly getting some healthier options when you go out and you also mention your soda consumption you may also have other things that we haven't mentioned today that you would like to discuss further so which would you like to discuss
C:	um I mean I guess I should really cut down and soda I mean I know it has a lot of sugar in it and maybe that'll help with the pre-diabetes a little bit I just get so tired throughout the day and like the caffeine obviously and a little bit of sure kick really helps me keep going throughout the day you know so
T:	so it sounds like your soda intake uh something that you know is that a control and you must not feel that energized if you have to keep drinking it throughout the day
C:	yeah I mean I do normally feel really a sluggish and fatigue all day long you know so it could be part of it
T:	so your soda consumptions a habit you'd like to break
C:	yeah I mean really in lieu of the shocking news it might be time to change
T:	so would you like to hear some ways that my other patients kind of get an energy boost that are not soda
C:	yeah I'm gonna say I would love any suggestions I mean my taller tolerance for caffeine has just increased so much that like some nays let me drink to three of these and I know that's not really recommended so yeah I would like to hear some alternatives
T:	so my other diabetic patients that like caffeine and a little sweet they will either have one cup of coffee in the morning or they'll drink unsweetened tea and if you like something we don't really condone artificial sweeteners but you could add a packet of stevia Splenda to your tea that's not a problem so how does that sound
C:	um I mean I sound I think that sounds okay um I do you like sweet tea or sweetie sometimes unsweet tea so I think I'll be okay with making that switch to like an unsweetened stevia or something so I mean I could definitely make some switches you know
T:	so you sound ready to make a change you sound ready to go um do you perceive any obstacles or challenges that you might foresee with changing your soda intake
C:	mm-hmm I definitely think I will crave the sugar I'm really afraid I won't make it throughout the day without caffeine you know so that I mean those are definitely things that I see as barriers you know to me making these changes you know
T:	so that's definitely a legitimate worry I think the smart thing to do is to gradually wean you off sooner um I think you might be feeling a little lethargic and fatigued just because you're dehydrated so maybe swapping out some of the soda for water tea somedays will definitely help you out
C:	um I mean that it sound it definitely sounds fine I think I can definitely swap out some of the soda with tea or coffee I mean that'll help me with the caffeine withdrawal you know and maybe I could even increase my water intake I know I heard it also helps with fatigue you know so I mean it's definitely doable and I'm living it something I could do
T:	great and next time we can even talk about your diet because I know fruit and vegetable intake can also give you a natural energy boost so
C:	yeah
T:	okay so those ideas sound really great in our sessions coming to a close I just wanted to thank you for being so open today and next time you come in we can talk about your diet and your soda consumption if you ever have any questions we're right here just give us a call but again thanks for coming in
C:	yeah sure I'll see you next time
