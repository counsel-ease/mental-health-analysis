T:	okay so I wrote a prescription for an antibiotic for Aidan that should help with the ear infection but in looking through this chart I mean it seems like he's had six or seven of these just in the past year or so that's really a big problem 
C:	yeah it's pretty stressful for both of us it gets really upset 
T:	well one of the primary risk factors for multiple ear infections and kids is actually smoke exposure are you smoking?
C:	yeah I yeah I do smoke but I don't smoke around him I try really hard not to smoke around him 
T:	well the fact that he's having these ear infections is indicating to me that he is being exposed to smoke and so what can you tell me about that?
C:	I I don't know I mean I try really hard not to smoke around him I don't smoke in the car when he's home I go outside to smoke I just I mean I know it's bad and I know it's bad for him so I don't want him to be around it so I try really hard
T:	I really need you to quit smoking both for your health and for Aidan did you know smoking around your child is associated not only with ear infections it could get to the point where you have to put tubes in his ears pretty shortly here also things like vitamin C do efficiency cavities like dental cavities behavior problems asthma other upper respiratory infections it's really putting him at a lot of risk in addition to that kids of smokers end up smoking themselves you want him to grow up to be a smoker?
C:	no but I don't smoke I'm I I I've thought about quitting but it's just it's really hard so I just don't know how to do it
T:	well now is the time to quit it's really gotten to the point where you can't keep smoking not only for him like I said but also for you you're putting yourself at risk for lung cancer for emphysema for oral cancers for heart disease for all kinds 
C:	I know I know I've heard people have told me before I've heard all that I just don't know how to do it how am I supposed to quit it's so hard 
T:	well there's all kinds of things you can use now it's not as hard as it used to be you can use nicotine replacement there's patches there's lozenges there's gum there's the inhaler there's nasal spray we can talk about medications you can try chantix you can try zyban there's quit smoking groups you can go to there's hotlines you can talk 
C:	don't have times 
T:	no reason why you shouldn't be able to quit this is really important 
C:	I understand that I know it is I mean everybody has problems right it's just really it's really really hard 
T:	well what can be more important to you than the health of your child?
C:	I don't know 
T:	I really need you to tell me that you're gonna quit smoking this is really important 
C:	oh I'll go look at all those things and I'll find I guess I'll try to find something and I'll talk to my doctor about it 
T:	okay well I think you really need to think about this seriously it like I said it's really putting yourself and your child in danger 
C:	okay whatever
T:	okay okay
