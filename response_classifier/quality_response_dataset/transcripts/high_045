T:	hi Patrick
C:	hey
T:	my name is Christina I'm gonna be the therapist today nice to meet you too so before we start I want to know if it was okay if I take notes 
C:	sure
T:	okay great so can you tell me a little bit about why you're here
C:	um no because I don't really know why I'm here my dad kind of just forced me to come
T:	okay why do you think he forced you to come
C:	no he's always forcing me to do stuff like whenever he wants me to do something he's always makes me do it it's not been asking if I want to do it you know it just makes me do it I never had these issues when I go visit my mom my mom was in New York and whenever I go visit her she's a lot more lenient she understands that if I have something that I need to get done I'll get it done she doesn't anyhow meet every second of the day to make sure I get it done if I want to go to Times Square as long as I stay within her rules and follow our rules she's okay with it the other week I went to Times Square with a friend and we hung out and it was a great day we got to go to Central Park we got to do all the stuff that I wouldn't been able to do if my mom had forced me to stay home I mean New York is an incredible City being able to walk around it explore it's so much fun and I just I mean I wouldn't be able to do it if I had been forced to stay at home I wouldn't have gone the neighborhood of Liberty we went and we just explored around and found all these cool little hidden places that we had never gone to before and it was so much fun
T:	awesome okay so um New York time look it was amazing let's go back to your dad so you said your dad made you come here is that right okay so can you tell me a little bit aSbout why you're frustrated looking
C:	I mean I don't really I guess it's just like I said because all of these making me do stuff that I don't want to do and he's always on me to do stuff that I have to get done I'm 17 years old he doesn't need to be on me 24/7 to get stuff done and he doesn't always he doesn't have to make me do stuff I don't want to do for example he always wants me to go to the store I don't always want to go to the store with him but it doesn't matter what I want he makes me go he food shopping he going to the fishing store the sporting goods store going to get crafts because he's a huge crafter like I don't need to go to those stores I don't want to go to those stores why does he make me go to these things doesn't since I don't do crafts another crafty person
T:	yeah totally okay so if I'm hearing this correctly you seem really frustrated because your dad is always making you do things like chores and making you you go with him to places that you don't really want to go to is that right
C:	yeah it's not so much the chores like I understand that totally bugs I have to get those done and that's the thing is I understand what I need to get stuff done I know when I have to do my homework I know when I have to do my chores I know when I have to get up and go to school I understand all that but even those things he's constantly on me to do he's constantly as soon as I get home from school or home from work do your homework do this do that I understand that I have to get it done he doesn't need a tummy when I get home from work I'm tired I mean I work on my feet all day I work at a coffee shop like I'm serving customers and I'm often tiring at home and I don't want to do my homework I shouldn't have to do my homework maybe I just want to want to be or play games or play computer
T:	okay so do you think that your dad doesn't understand that you're tired
C:	I don't even I don't know about that I mean I think he understands I mean he gets it it's just you constantly on me to do stuff and I don't know why I don't
T:	okay so if I'm hearing this correctly you seem really frustrated because your dad is micromanaging a little bit
C:	a lot of it yeah he is trying to control every second of my life like I said I'm here I am he made me come here I didn't want to come here and offends you I'm sure you're a great person I'm sure you have a lot of friends and whatever but I don't want to be here that's just he made me come
T:	okay so why don't we try something if that's okay with you I want you to talk to the chair like as if your dad was there I want you to tell the chair or your dad how you feel
C:	like that
T:	yep
C:	I guess I would just say that tell him that I don't need him controlling every aspect of my life at
T:	before you continue can you try to talk to the chair as if your dad was sitting there
C:	like actually look out of the chair okay I guess I would just say dad listen like you don't need to be on me 24/7 to get stuff done like I'm 17 I am gonna be going to college soon I know how to control what I need to get done in my life I know how to manage everything like don't get me wrong I know that you probably just have my best interests at heart but I don't need you every 10 seconds saying make sure you do this make sure you do that you need to do that you need to do that every now and then is a different story if you really want me to go to the store with you every now and then that's not that big a deal it's just when it's every single time that I've had the issue or if you just take the time and say every now and then it'd be like hey just don't forget you have to do this if you knew that like once every every we've got a couple of times a week even just once a day something like that it's gonna be a lot better than you just constantly saying make sure you get this stuff done
T:	okay can you tell me about how that talked you're talking to the chair talking to your dad
C:	different I mean I guess I kind of realized that I might need a little angry with him and that might be why he want me to come but I mean it got it felt kind of nice to get that off my chest instead of just holding it in
T:	good okay so it sounds to me like you're a little frustrated we get that I get a little angry that you are having a hard time with him telling you what to do you feel like you're an adult is that right so you feel like you're an adult you feel like your dad doesn't really understand that that there's kind of an imbalance there okay so I think we had a really good first session I want you if you can come back next week and we're gonna try to figure out how to talk to your dad so he can better understand that is that okay
C:	sure all right it was nice to meet you see you next week
