T:	well Jessica once we tell me what brings you here today
C:	and I've just been feeling really unhappy lately firstly
T:	you can feel happy
C:	yeah I just my family I just been really upset with my husband and I'm kind of curious are starting to think about it may be leaving him might be something I need to do
T:	with your husband
C:	yeah and I mean um a one hand I know that that's where i'm wanting to go possibly but on the other hand i'm wanting to stay so I'm kind of torn between if that's where i go with it
T:	so you feel torn stuck between decisions about
C:	yeah and it's just I don't know what which way I need to go right now ok so it's Rick me feel like you need to leave your husband well lately hey jess has a good helping me or parenting our son's one a damn cat scratch fever and so we've been having to make a lot of visits to the emergency room and he has not been going with me to these visits and he also has not they have been watching the other son Wong going to the hospital and it's just been adding a lot of stress on me
T:	so sometimes you're stressed because your son's how's his health issues
C:	some sporting a nice pen somebody other than providing nothing yeah and I mean it's just been very stressful life I just I want him to be the father figure you know one him I wanted to be a partnership in handling our children but he just I've told you this a hundred times and he's just not listening to me like we're at the hospital I he was just like i'll be there and then he never showed up and I mean I don't want that but on the other hand I don't want I really don't believe him neither so I'm kind of stuck on what I need to do you I don't know what the best decision is so we're here is like the other idea of my vonage of being a partnership from supporting in advance and he's not very  same time you understand yeah yeah it's I want to stay with him for his relationship with my son's I don't want to take I'm scared if I take their father under their life you know they may not have a relationship with them anymore and I don't want to hurt that
T:	okay sounds like email about it sometime relationship with his father you feel is 50 leaving the relationship will be damaged it someone
C:	yeah he's I mean he's not he isn't it being the best parent right now for as far as a partner but I know he cares about them and I know that you know my son's look up to them very much so what would be the worst case so you want to for Charm School but it would hurt their relationship that he might decide that he doesn't to be a quarter lessons life at all and then I taken their father away from you you know that's what I feel like at least that that would hurt film he also very normal fears about messing up the family
T:	mm-hmm separating your kids
C:	yeah that's something that I worry about for the rest of course
T:	if you were to leave them
C:	well that he was still continued have a relationship with employees but I would be able to find happiness because I might be right extremely happy and I don't see him changing in the future because this is the gone off a few years and I'm talking about it and he's just very he's not going to change right now and so I would the best case scenario would be that I would be able to find someone later or finding myself to be happy but you know I'm just not it's bringing me down happiness is a party but as well as you your son's happiness
T:	yeah and said I mean that's what I'm Stefan is that do I stay with him and even though I'm unhappy and even though he's not being emotionally supportive for me so that he could have that relationship with my son or do I leave him and possibly hurt their relationship but by a find better support for myself
C:	so if you have some someone feels about keeping your family together what's coming happen
T:	yeah maybe this up
C:	okay your feelings
T:	yeah and he's um he's hidden danone considering leaving him I mean I started it in the past but he just always ignored it and just blow it all I child leaving him before but I never was able to do it for more than a couple of days hey this is my hair I mean or like with the parenting thing I want to get there I'll me get better but it never happens so what's up a lot of fun
C:	but you have to see this behavior
T:	yeah and so that's why it because they give you more depressed is that I'm just stuck and I don't I don't know what to do instead become go stalking approach
C:	yeah yeah
T:	I mean it's just I'm crying all the time I'm all happy i'm feeling so overwhelmed with everything i'm having to do and i'm getting a lot of stress for my parents because they're having to help out a lot because he's slacking they build that since I married that he should be helping me financially it should be helping me words against and that she's not happening
C:	stressful your family also seems to have you feel things should be supporting these one
T:	yeah it's just it's causing a hard the conflict in my life and I just never know it she's making me really happy sounds back around doing nothing everyone i am basically doing the same routine besides going to take my son to all the doctor visits and hospital visits I have no friends because I don't have any time to myself because I'm basically a single parent even if someone else's in the household I I'm not I don't have anything to do outside of the house and I hard time
C:	you do anything I saw the house sounds like
T:	yeah yeah I know I'm the annoying if we weren't together my family would be more helpful you know they even offer me any support if I just leave you know that I could live a diff and that would help me with the boys but for now you know they're kind of saying it as he is to step up since he's the one I'm living with it is just not happening and I'm always stressed as well about money because he's he's not providing adequate finances for our family there's times where hundreds and hundreds dollars go missing him off them here's no idea where it's gone too and that's very stressful so all so much for the money
C:	sorry yeah I mean I'm just be sure you're happy about the situation but I don't want to make the wrong decision and hurt our children either so what would be your first step just like a better point if you wanted to to link them
T:	so you know um I guess to figure out where i'm going to say my parents had offered her place i have a couple friends who offered a lot of jobs so i would have to stay with somebody else
C:	don't you feel about making their stuff
T:	I would I mean right now I'm I feel like I'm not ready to do that to take that except I feel like I'm scary at first steps best food we've been comfortable with yeah and I don't want to have to explain to a child you know why mommy her mommy both boys are moving to make plays
C:	so we've got a lot of thoughts in your head the buildings in Smith just give her stuff to have done people want to tell you something that you weren't even husband about it
T:	yeah yeah and i don't mean I values the love moments into I don't want to it makes me sad to think that I feel me more like you know like my husband anymore if I do that ok you may not we may not be able to work it out if I go through you know how am I actually and that's splitting up so it's scary soon over i watch mr. bone switch your family yeah and it's um it's worrisome picking their steps so I'm so far the probe
C:	the Miller one support from your husband which are not getting that but Gail may not look at that at the same time do you want to stand it has a family and even if the support is not much new happen it's much better than what you feel not again if you what I mean
T:	yeah yeah I'm just really stuck between the two yarders don't know where I'm going to go from here I'm really telling martin's right now but I know that I really don't be sad
