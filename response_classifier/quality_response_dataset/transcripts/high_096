T:	good afternoon miss fish I would like to personally thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to talk to us regarding smoking cessation we're basically going to go through a few questions that will help both of us get a better understanding about your current smoking status and I'm going to just take some notes here as we continue to talk okay first of all how long has you have you been smoking and at what age did you begin to 
C:	think I was   that's about  years  years okay okay
T:	and in those  years had you ever trying to quit 
C:	yeah I tried once when I was pregnant but it just didn't work okay I know I hear it's not worth even the time to be honest 
T:	okay well that's fine I mean what you definitely deserve some applause for you know your willingness to quit in it as you know smoking is a very difficult habit to quit especially for a time I paid like  years so what were your reasons behind wanting to quit in those previous tips 
C:	really is one one main time and is right for it right when I got pregnant the doctor kept nagging me my mom kept nagging me they just kept saying how bad it was for my baby and finally I just got tired of fighting the battle and I quit
T:	okay okay then and then what did your physician tell you about more of the specific dangers in continuing to smoke
C:	he really didn't say anything just that it was bad 
T:	he just said it was bad  okay so if I understand you correctly miss Fisher on you saying that you have been smoking for  years with several attempts to quit in the past but ultimately no long-term success okay both your mother and other family members along with your physician have told you several times on that you need to quit but neither of those individuals everyone into the overall specifics about the actual dangers of wanting to quit smoking is that does that sound about right yeah pretty much okay
T:	okay so let's kind of take it one step forward um and those are tips to quit in the past what was it that you know made you start back smoking again 
C:	well I needed it to get through the day it calms my nerves I crave it I want a few of kids but they're stressful stressful and I just can't make it without one 
T:	okay okay then well that's that's quite all right in this fish I mean we have we have a multitude of patients that mentioned those particular reasons specifically right there also you know as you know I mean but I would say that we've had also great successes working with those patients and ultimately getting them to quit smoking so there's there isn't any lost hope with that so let's let's move into talking about your reasons for wanting to quit should you should you desire to do so what will be those reasons for wanting to quit if you decide to do so 
C:	I still think it's a lost cause but I'm not sure I guess something on TV it says it's back to health my doctor said is bad for my health my mom says it's bad for my health so I guess it's bad for my health I've smoked for so long I don't notice anything to me it's what gets me through my day 
T:	okay then get you through the day okay well well tell me this what was the longest period of time that you were able to quit in the past you know since you mentioned the previous quit attempts
C:	guess the pregnancy so about nine months or so I started back pretty much day one after my baby's born
T:	okay why are you able to quit for nine months that's it that's it that's a pretty big accomplishment miss Fisher if you think about it that's pretty much close to in close to an entire year you know do you does that make sense that that's a pretty long period of time you know one whole year why don't you 
C:	definitely think about it
T:	okay I mean and I can and I believe it's safe to say that was a pretty tough decision considering the fact that you've been smoking for  years right one okay and so basically the fact that you are willing to take it upon yourself in the meantime to quit while you're pregnant that speaks volumes of you you know so that would that would basically lead into my next question you on what would have been the worst thing that could have happened to you if you had quit me smoke if you have started to quit smoking for good after your pregnancy 
C:	yes there's nothing bad
T:	nothing bad okay okay what Mina in my opinion I believe you're you're exactly right no as you well know I mean the the the journey to quitting smoking is very difficult but if you think about it you yourself you were able to quit for almost a year now you were able to quit for nine months so just as you were able to quit during your pregnancy for the sake of the kids you know you can use that same sort of energy to want to have the desire to quit for the sake of your own health in order to see your kids grow up to be you know healthy individuals also okay and that's and that's really something to think about so I guess my next question for you miss Fisher would be more like a scenario question so if you can kind of roll with me on that on the scale of one to ten how important is it for you to consider thinking about quitting smoking sooner rather than later with one being not important at all or ten being the utmost and most important 
C:	five okay well well
T:	why a five and not a three or four 
C:	I guess you pointed out I did it for nine months cold turkey so maybe I could do it again for longer in this time for my health they're not for my babies okay
T:	alright that's it and that's a great point that you bring out to me miss Fisher on I believe this gives us some some great foundation you know should we decide to move forward with this to with the smoking cessation if it's okay with you I would really like to schedule another interview with you or another point we can actually sit down and go into further detail about about these other barriers that people face on there when they're smoking and also share with you some of the great benefits that that can come of quitting smoking on would that be something that you would be interested in yeah okay well that would be great I mean I would like to thank you again for coming by and we can schedule you an appointment for advocate I was saying about one week does that work for you yeah time free okay and in the meantime I like to come and hand you this tobacco log right here this isn't it this isn't an attempt to help you quit rather it would help us identify some specific triggers and identify triggers that you may face along the road to quitting smoking okay well thank you very much and you have a good rest of the day okay nice meeting
