T: so let me tell you what I normally do in this this interview and we will talk for up to it maybe 20 minutes or so normally what I do is just give some feedback from all of those questionnaires that you answered last week and then we just talk together about that so but I always like to just start with wherever you would like to start 
C: yeah yep I mean like when I was doing those questionnaires it was weird because I mean I guess I don't really think about like you have looked drinking and being like this huge deal and I don't ever really think about like like how much I drink um and like sit like filling out like how much I'm drinking every day was like whoa you know like I just didn't ever really think about it like that I was like if I try to actually count the drinks it's kind of a lot I mean it's kind of a lot 
T: you were pretty shocked at what you learned about your patterns
C:	yeah cause like I also kind of thought that like I drank like about as much as my friends did and then like I went back and I was like talking to my roommate about it and I was like telling her that you know I was drinking like like ten drinks on the weekends like including Thursday so like Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday mm-hm and then she was like Sarah that's quick like that is crazy why you know like where are you drinking this and I was I was like well you know like different places I I guess like I don't know my friends didn't like know anyway
T:	yeah yep yeah this information has opened your eyes in some ways and as you talked to your roommate about it she was even shocked to know that you were drinking as much as you as you realized when you did the questionnaire 
C:	yeah and yeah I guess it was just like I thought that everybody was like doing it you know but that's not really what's going on 
T:	yeah the fact that you're drinking stands out from others is clearly not something you had ever really taken into consideration before thus far I am very
C:	 yeah yes so that was a thing that like was really the most weird about doing those forms
