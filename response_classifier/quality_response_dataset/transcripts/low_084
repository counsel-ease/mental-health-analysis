T:	so there anything else we can help you with today Jeff before we go 
C:	no that's all of it 
T:	great what I'd like to do just before you go is your recall in your reception the receptionist gave you a questionnaire to fill in 
C:	yeah 
T:	I just like to talk to you about their she enters it in the computer and I see from the way you filled it in we at the moment from a perspective of your health will classify your physical activity is inactive 
C:	what 
T:	inactive so at the moment I'm like we're going to 
C:	have a very busy life 
T:	perhaps what I could tell you is looked at the moment the current recommendation for health is that everybody should do  minutes of moderate exercise at least five days that the week that's to benefit their head I fleets you mean now everybody
C:	why why would I want to do that much 
T:	what's really important is particularly as somebody your age is you're really entering that age where we really need to think about heart disease diabetes
C:	it's nothing wrong with my health and
T:	that's that's how we'd like to keep it of course and if you were to exercise at that level what we know is you half your risk of getting heart disease having high blood pressure getting diabetes gaining weight etc and of course my concern is that you're healthy at the moment we keep you there 
C:	so what are you telling me but 
T:	what we really need to discuss is how we can get you to be a bit more physically active start moving this along a little bit 
C:	I have a very busy life 
T:	so you do a lot of things but from where you feel this in you really don't do enough physical activity to benefit your help or 
C:	give me for disagreeing with you but when you run a business but I do I mean I've got  i got  people in my company what you're saying it do you think it's easy running a company is it buddy chica thing you got telling me I'll growth when am I supposed to take time to get that don't want to go the gym edge imagine how running your cum I'm not aware the factory all day long you think that's not exercise I'm not sitting at a desk like you I'm sure you're all I Gobert all right I just like night 
T:	I understand that you're on the go all the time but what's really important is no more that you protect your health now imagine running your business if you're held in the dark deteriorate 
C:	there's nothing wrong with my health 
T:	and that's the way we'd like to keep it of course and what I'm really concerned about is all men of your age of my age is our health now is at a point where it starts to you know we have to think about heart disease and things like diabetes and one really good way of protecting ourselves this is to be physically active well we'll go around in circles it because i would say i am particularly active well
C:	what are you telling me i should do that i don't do 
T:	well if you think about that recommendation that any equivalent if you like of walk in two to three miles an hour a day at a fairly fast pace there are things equivalent to that not just being on the go that's you know marching rather than strolling mm-hmm
C:	and when would you like me to do this i mean i'm at work six thirty in the morning often don't go home till eight o'clock at night 
T:	well ideally this is something to do every day this is kind of a minimum amount of physical activity
C:	there can't be done 
T:	well one of the things i should tell you about is that not doing this so not doing much physical activity does really increase this one of the most important risk factors for heart disease for some cancers colon cancer that affects many men and for elevated blood pressure all the things that we see are getting common in men as they get older start to become more risky if we avoid physical activity 
C:	yeah are you just trying to scare me now aren't you I'm not equate I don't need I don't need all this 
T:	so it's a genuine concern and obviously part of my job is to let you know about my concern and make sure you've got the right information to make decisions about your health and this is one of the important things you can't 
C:	okay well I've got time to go walking every day so what's the next best thing I can do 
T:	well the good news is you don't have to do it all in one gut you can do  minutes in the morn in  minutes at lunch time and ten minutes of an evening that would still lead to important health benefits I see anything in the bigger scheme of things is  minutes investment in your health worth it 
C:	well people don't like that well of course is I don't to get sick but I die I just don't think it's necessary but I'm perfectly healthy so what why do you think it's so important
T:	oh because the evidence tells us it really is an important risk factor similar in the way that smoking is we know now obviously everyone takes it as a bit of given that smoking's not really a good thing to do for their health and we're realizing that physical activity is the same avoiding physical activity is as much of a risk to your health as smoking is  C;	well well what else could I do 
T:	well I'd like you to really give some thought to doing a good brisk walk in the mornings every day and again in the evenings and you turn me walking around the factory is not enough 
T:	well I suspect I don't know of course but I suspect it's not really the equivalent of a good March for ten continuum minutes 
C:	can I ask you a personal question well you say you know we're men of a simulator much exercise do you get 
T:	well I try like you I've got a busy job and we're always on call etc but i do really try and fit in a good strong walk every day does that mean you do it every day most days most days I do
C:	well if you could do I suppose I could do it 
T:	I think I do really think it's very important for you 
C:	you think it would make a big difference 
T:	I think you'd be surprised how much difference it made and indeed when you're at work I suspect you know it'll help with the energy you have for that busy job and in the long term it yeah one way to think about it it's a real investment in the future 
C:	I'm not convinced 
T:	Jeff family Jeff 
C:	yes I have family 
T:	so you can imagine at some point in the future you know you don't want to be in a situation where you you know want to play with the grandchildren for example and you can't because you simply unfit 
C:	yeah well my grandchildren live overseas and actually so I don't get to see the left mmm 
T:	but you see my point 
C:	goodbye I'm not stupid
T:	you don't want your lack of fitness no I mean how you behind on you know of course that I supply golf but I doubt the time these days mm-hmm take 
T:	you have been fitter 
C:	what I was younger yeah yeah
T:	so you think that's something you could do again 
C:	no yeah because you know it says it is a popular pastime and it of course unless rubbish at it and I've got walking is a different matter I want what more bye dad is he really true walking did make a difference 
T:	yes if you do it briskly mm-hmm this is 
C:	I do everything bristly 
T:	yeah well walk walking briskly does lead to very substantial health benefits yeah and
C:	well I'll try it I'm going to 
T:	when do you think you will do something
C:	when I because these things you can imagine you're easy to agree to and then we meet again in a few weeks time and 
C:	i'll tell you what i'll do then ok you've been straight with me I'll be straight with you instead of driving to work i'll walk to work that will take me  minutes that'd be fantastic that's right well I'll get my chauffeur to take me home 
T:	ok so deal then mm-hmm when we should start doing that geez 
C:	I could do it tomorrow ok so deal with 
T:	then you're going to do  minutes of brisk walking today give it a try 
C:	yeah if it does it up and I'm feeling different after a month I won't bother anymore because it be frank it's an inconvenience but i'll do it for you 
T:	why don't you and I meet again in a month mmm take stop and you can tell me what you found out yeah and then we'll have another chat about it then ok all right we'll do that ok alright fair enough thanks Jeff see you again in a month
