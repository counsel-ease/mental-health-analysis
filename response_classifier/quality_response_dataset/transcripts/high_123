T:	hi Liz hi welcome back 
C:	thank you 
T:	how are you 
C:	I'm feeling pretty intense things have kind of gone downhill since I was here last time 
T:	well I'm sorry to hear that 
C:	yeah I know 
T:	last time we talked um you and Kelly had just gotten engaged and you were rather excited about plans that you had for your life so so tell me what has happened what what is what's shifted 
C:	I think that we've just sort of fallen back you know I was really hopeful that you know what the proposal also came the the promise to you know work on the relationship and work on her anger and work on you know being the couple that we we hope to be and that it's not happening it's not happening we're right back to where we were 
T:	I'm sorry to hear that I know you were you're excited you were feeling hopeful for change and I don't get that same sense from you right now in fact it seems like you're feeling pretty sad and maybe even a little hopeless 
C:	yeah about situation 
T:	well how can I may how can I be helpful and supportive and useful to you right now?
C:	i just i don't i don't know how to make change i don't know how to I don't know how to end this i don't know how to get out i don't know how to I just I can't do it anymore so you've decided to make a change and in fact it sounds like you've decided to leave the relationship I don't know I I mean I want to I don't want to be in it but I don't I don't know how to get to not being in it 
T:	so you're thinking about it it's not that you've committed or decided that you absolutely want to leave the relationship but correct me if I'm wrong what you're saying is you want to make a change and you don't want this relationship as it is
C:	yeah 
T:	now what when you think about changing what what ideas i mean i guess you mentioned leaving what other possibilities or thoughts have you had about change and what that might look like 
C:	I don't know it just feels so overwhelming when I think about it I just I can't seem to find a way out of it and that feels feels ethical feels like it and you know I don't want to hurt her I just don't want to be in this relationship anymore 
T:	why don't you want to be in this relationship anymore?
C:	it's not healthy it's I'm not happy I can't imagine that she's happy even though she says she is it's you know we're fighting constantly I feel like I'm walking on eggshells with her she's overprotective she yeah it just doesn't feel right 
T:	you just doesn't feel right it doesn't feel right 
C:	yeah 
T:	and so um so what would feel right?
C:	oh that's a huge question hmm I just don't I'm not sure just this isn't right 
T:	so the way things are is not right it's not working you don't feel supported this isn't the kind of relationship that that you want or that you had hoped that it would be 
C:	yeah I mean when we started it was was lovely she is amazing she was this super caring and thoughtful woman and you know we were lots of same interests you know same friends it's you know she was just fantastic and I don't know I don't know where that changed and I feel like we did this on-again off-again stuff and it's just it just seems to like just not right and I know I know I'm don't deserve to be treated this way I know that I'm I'm better than that 
T:	mm-hmm you really value your self and your well-being and in your spirit and it sounds like you don't feel like you're taking good care of yourself by staying in this relationship and even though things started out well they haven't turned out to be the kind of relationship that you want for yourself no but you know but she's lovely 
C:	and I love her and I can't imagine I can't imagine my life without her in it 
T:	mm-hmm so you're feeling torn 
C:	yeah
T:	you're you're torn between your love and affection for her and your sense of honoring yourself and you've got a lot of mixed feelings and you are saying that you need something to change that sounds like you're able to kind of hold that complexity if you will that you've got these strong feelings for this person and you don't feel like this is the a good relationship for you know 
C:	I think it's good for either one of us 
T:	mhm for both of you 
C:	yeah 
T:	well so so then you've talked a little bit about leaving
C:	I mean 
T:	tell me more about what you've thought about and when you think about making a change in terms of leaving what what might that look like for you 
C:	i I don't know i mean it feels I just can't imagine my life without her in it so the idea of not having her there feels really scary and the idea of staying the way it is and things not changing feels even scarier so I don't I don't know how to and I don't even know how I would do that our lives are so intertwined I mean my business our friends are the queer community is so small you know that's my fam those are as much as my friends and my family as well and so just you know
T:	how do you how do you extract yourself from that in a way 
C:	you know for me like in a way that I feel I'm doing that with grace and respect for her and respect for myself 
T:	what what thoughts do you have about how you do that how do extract yourself how might you extract yourself in a way that has some integrity and grace as you said 
C:	i don't i don't even know I mean talk to my friend Jay about it and I don't know he suggested like a break but I don't know I just don't want to get caught in that on again off again before like you know like we've done before and but the idea of a break feels a little less I don't know maybe more gentle 
T:	mm-hmm 
C:	I don't I don't know same or a little more gentle I don't know how to give us both time to really think about it and and I don't know maybe maybe she'll change maybe maybe if I'm you know if this is it if this is it like if this break is it maybe maybe she'll be able to change
T:	mm-hmm I heard you say that live you know moving on and having a life without Kelly is really scary in fact it's almost impossible for you to imagine what that would look like especially with the way that your lives are so intertwined I also heard you say that the thought of not making a change is scarier and I was wondering if you could say a little bit more about what you mean by that 
C:	it's just I feel exhausted i feel like i'm not i'm not who I was when I came into this relationship I feel like I'm constantly struggling to make her happy and that just doesn't work there's nothing I can do and I feel like I've lost my joy 
T:	mm-hmm 
C:	and I don't know I'm just afraid of what will happen if I just keep staying in a place where I feel like I'm falling apart 
T:	mm-hmm 
C:	my peace 
T:	yeah so you're concerned about your own well-being in your own joy and your your spirit if you you stay and don't make this change and that's the part that's really scary for you 
C:	yeah
T:	you mentioned that your friend suggested possibly taking a little break and you said that that was a scary thought for you and I guess I'd like to hear more our additional thoughts you might have about that as a as an option for you
C:	well I'd it seems like I mean if it could happen if we could find a way to make it happen that it would be it would just give me some time to think about like what I want and what I need and and you know I feel like I can't sort out what's me in this anymore and and so like if I had that space just to sort of breathe and not have to worry about her feelings and taking care of her and just being able to focus on myself for a little while I don't know it seems like that would be helpful 
T:	it sounds like you're feeling like you're so in in it just so in the the mixed emotions and the sense of hopelessness and sadness and disappointment that it's really hard for you to see out of it and an advantage a reason to take a break would be just to give you a moment to breathe and look around and collect yourself and not be so stuck in that ambivalence if you will that sense of not knowing 
C:	yeah
T:	well if you don't mind I'd love to ask you to take a look at this ruler here I just kind of wrote this down really quickly but on a scale of  to   being not motivated at all and  being extremely motivated how motivated would you say you are to take a break in your relationship right now 
C:	Oh like  somewhat motivated yeah 
T:	why is six and not a one 
C:	cuz I know it needs I need it I feel like I'm losing myself so I feel like it's as important 
T:	yeah well so so why I six and not a nine or ten 
C:	cuz I'm not sure how to make it happen 
T:	hmm yeah
C:	I don't I don't know 
T:	so it's important to you and you're not maybe fully confident or sure about how the how part yeah make it home exactly well kind of following up on that on a scale of  to   not confident at all ten being extremely confident how confident are you that if you decided to take a break from relationship with Kelly you would be successful at making that happen 
C:	oh I don't know maybe like a three or four
T:	okay so so less confident you're a little less confident than you are motivated why a three and not a zero
C:	because I I'm on it I mean I do it's something I want 
T:	mm-hmm and so wanting it makes you feel confident that you confident to some extent that you could actually make it happen why a three and not an eight or a nine 
C:	I I can't control her I don't know how she would react and I just don't want any more arguments and anger and yeah and I don't hurt her 
T:	so when you think about taking this break you're also thinking about how shy she might respond and what she might do and that creates a whole other kind of set of worries and it undermines your sense of confidence on some level 
C:	it creates a lot of anxiety for me
T:	yeah what do you think needs to be different in order for you to feel more confident about successfully being able to take a brief break 
C:	I think I like maybe a plan like just knowing knowing what the rules are sort of like where where where I want to go with it and and what I'm hope I don't know what I want to accomplish 
T:	so thinking through an actual plan like what you would say how long what the boundaries are might might help you 
C:	yeah regard 
T:	okay and then one final question on a scale of  to   being not ready at all and  being extremely ready how ready would you say you are to commit to taking some kind of brief break and that let's say the next couple of weeks
C:	hey Nate Nate yeah 
T:	so so pretty ready
C:	yeah 
T:	and and you've spoken to this already a little bit i believe but I'll ask you again why and eight and not on a one or two 
C:	because I know if I just let it drag out that I'm gonna be miserable
T:	so your sense of readiness is actually really connected to your motivation that is that this is something you know that you need to do for yourself and if you don't things are not going to get any better and that that makes you both motivated and even more ready well why why an eight and not a  
C:	lets you know scary change is hard and thinking about not being with the woman I thought I was gonna marry bits that makes me sad 
T:	so your emotions your sense of maybe sadness and in grief and disappointment around this detract from your sense of readiness and in some way sort of giving up on a dream 
C:	yeah 
T:	and so another aspect of enter your whole experience is that you're you're grieving mm-hmm the really should should be isn't even over yet but you're grieving the dream and the hopes that you had and that's a that's a heaviness and certainly a factor in and what you do next 
C:	yeah 
T:	well if I could take just a moment and make sure I've captured and understood everything you've shared with me and I I know this is really difficult to talk about so I really appreciate you spending the time to share with me with with this has been like for you you've been feeling stuck and things were great for a while you had some hope that things were going to change and now you realizing that Kelly's not going to change and that you are suffering in the process that you are really being kept from your aspirations in your dreams in a lot of different regards you know that you need to make a change you want to make a change and you have a lot of mixed feelings about this change you know it's what you want to do it's the right thing for you and you still really care and love Kelly and you're also concerned kind of on an outer level about your business about your community about your family and your friends and how they may be affected by a breakup in order to make this more manageable you're thinking maybe in terms of smaller change like taking a small break as opposed to breaking off the relationship and you feel like you're pretty ready you're somewhat you know you're motivated and it may be a little less confident but you also said that if you were able to maybe think through a concrete plan that that might help you feel more confident
C:	yeah
T:	and that's certainly something that we could do together next time we meet if that's all right with you I'd be happy to hear your ideas maybe even share some suggestions with you about a possible plan that big daddy 
C:	all right yeah yeah thank you 
T:	thank you very much for your time live 
C:	I really appreciate
