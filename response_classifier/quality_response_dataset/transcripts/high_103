T:	Hi thank you for coming 
C:	okay well I'm not quite sure what to do with this you know just let me tell you that I was I was pulled over for weeding and so they told me that my license was gonna be suspended and when I came here they told me that I had to get an evaluation when I came here the woman out at the front desk said just that I had to take a test before I came to you so I took this I guess it's you know a few questions about about my drinking and but I you know I just want to explain that I was seeing my son in Buffalo and I had probably you know three three margaritas and then they you know I got on the road and was driving back to Erie and they pulled me over and told me I was weeding so they said then I have to do this so I guess I should just get you 
T:	I'll take this thank you talking I want to thank you for filling you know how did you find the actual checkup itself
C:	well I don't know it's you know I mean it's asking me about drinking I haven't thought about a lot of these questions before okay um I see Chris of course he 
T:	was X go over together sure what asked for this checkup it looks like you scored a thirteen okay which is about a medium so friend dividuals that score  but this is indicating is that year at least at risk for developing some alcohol-related problems and that you may start to experience some difficulties as as it's related to that what do you think
C:	well I hadn't thought I had any alcohol problems but I guess this test is indicating that I will or do and I'd certainly open to hear any more 
T:	yeah it was definitely kidding you're at risk for developing some popular related issues and now okay and it sounds to me from reading this should I say it looks like we might be able to do some things that occurred that listen to some of these examples 
C:	okay 
T:	and I see here that for the third question it says how often do you have four more drinks on one occasion you put monthly could you tell me about this for more drinks on one occasion well you know occasionally you know I usually have a couple glasses of wine with dinner and occasionally I'll just you know then have a couple margaritas after that so I would say that happens about once a month maybe your holidays  
T:	so more towards holidays you're more likely that for money for drink some more yeah and what have you ever thought of that to be I have something that's unusual or is it something tradition you always had 
C:	well I think I've been drinking more than I used to I certainly didn't use that two glasses of wine at every meal 
T:	so lately it's been more frequent yeah okay
C:	would you be able to tell me what what if there's infection happening more frequent and excuse me piping lately that's contributed said printing a little more people
C:	well I'm alone more I mean my son he's just he's in Buffalo and now he's just going to college and I guess I'm feeling more like a more time instead of everything fix things for him I do what I need to do 
T:	 okay I see here also that question was how often during the last year have you had feelings of guilt or remorse Tony drinking you put less than a month left about that 
C:	well I you know I think alcohol is expensive and like I go through tequila fairly much more quickly than I used to and so you know occasionally I'll get guilty about that like I could be spending the money on painting the door 
T:	what I'm hearing is it sounds like you might feel like maybe who's managing money to a degree the last yeah any other feelings of guilt or remorse surrounding it aside from the financial aspect 
C:	no no not so much guilt or remorse I think I feel sad and this time 
T:	I think you have a close relation are you in contact with him often 
C:	well he's studying you know so well not so much 
T:	okay I also like to look at number eight and the question was how often during the last year have you been able to remember what happened the night before because you have interacted here you felt less than a month so about it doesn't seem that it's that it's that frequent but there have been times we haven't remember what's happening that there's anything 
C:	well you know I'll watch shows when I'm on my celebration days month on month on and watch shows and a lot of times I'll try to tell somebody what happened in the show and I can't remember so that's what it is  
T:	okay had there been are there other instances in which maybe you couldn't remember certain facts about the day that you contributed  to drinking 
C:	well I don't know whether I attribute those to drinking or not but certainly my numbers not as good as it was
T:	that makes sense I may be too also number  Alaska let's review it says has a relative or friend or a doctor or other health care worker and concerned about your drinking or suggested you clip down and you put yester in the last year 
C:	well my son even though if he's fixing margaritas he will tell me that I shouldn't be drinking down there zone before I get on the road so that's the relative that's expressed some concern 
T:	have you guys had this conversation often
C:	no I I mean I go and see him maybe once every three months so I he knows I like margaritas so they'll fix me margaritas but you know usually be before I leave and he usually expresses concern so probably about once every three months 
T:	how far is the district from where you live to where his colleges about two hours about two hours so you guys get together spend some quality time and then towards the ending of your state you'll have a drink or a fixture margarita and then you'll get on the road yeah and um that sounds like the scenario they probably have lets you being pulled over 
T:	yeah I'm wondering if if in lieu of what's happening in kind of in lieu of what this assessment has highlighted what do you think about the connection this window with that particular activity and the drug in home 
C:	well I think it's a wake-up call that I shouldn't be combining the two as much as I am so I know they're going to ask me to do some things for as treatment goes through to get my license back so I imagine that you have a program here that I can sign off for or something 
T:	we do have some services you can't stand up before and what I'm hearing is something maybe open to something like that sure which I think it is really important for our success together 
C:	well that's embarrassing and I hate telling people that I was pulled over for weeding 
T:	you know these things happen and I think it's very important that you're here and that you're speaking to me about this particular issue and I think it's even more important that you're going to do something about it and I think she got to text me success okay wonderful it's great to hear that thanks thanks so much to doing this was absolutely like you understood that explain this I'm totally open because this has never happened
