T:	hi mr. snow
C:	hey
T:	how are you doing today I'm Bruce Berger I work on the case manager with your health plan I understand that you came in today to talk about your diabetes
C:	yeah I'm supposed to learn how to manage it I just learned that I got diabetes and apparently it's pretty bad because she said my blood sugar was sky-high and she laid all these huge consequences on things that can happen that just sounds so disastrous and then she told me I've got to do all this stuff man it's just source disappointment right now
C:	so you just you just saw the doctor and you know you sound like you just got blindsided with not only how how frightening this seems that you have diabetes and that she you say she told you a whole lot of things that can happen on your eyes and circulation and all those kinds of things actually
T:	my legs having troubles and
C:	so you're really kind of reeling right now from all of that and saying you sound a little bit pretty pretty scared actually
T:	well that's yeah it's not just being scared you know I don't want that to happen to me but then one when when she reels off all these things I got to do and I'm sort of you know I'm not certain I can even get it done so it's sort of simple you know I'm sitting here thinking that oh my god this is this is what's going to happen to me as a discourage
T:	yes so a slight discard it sounds a lot like on top of the fact that you've got something you're really scared about having consequences in terms of everything that can happen what worries you also is all the different things that she told you you're going to need to do to get it under control and I can't imagine doing all those things so you almost feel like all that bad stuff is going to happen
C:	yeah it looks like a massive task that I'm may not be able to handle and yeah all this horrible stuff happens to me I mean it's it's a relief looking situation
T:	okay and I and what I want to do is help you kind of break this up into some some doable chunks so that we can get your blood sugar down on you know on the one hand you're doctors right you know your blood sugar is very high and we do want to get it down so that we don't have those consequences happen and and there are a number of things that you need to do in order to to get your blood sugar down you know on the other hand we can take this a step at a time so it's not so overwhelming and I'd like you to be able to tell me what kinds of things that you can do right now you know for example there's basically three things that need to be worked out with diabetes taking your medicine as prescribed and honestly if I was going to work on one thing right away given that everything seems so overwhelming would probably that do that first because that'll have the biggest impact how does that sound so far
C:	well I don't think too much trouble in taking the medicines especially since I understand what blood Sugar's really high
T:	so that sounds doable
C:	yeah I'm pretty good yeah
T:	because it looks like you need to just take your medicine once a day from from the prescription so that sounds doable right now
C:	yeah I think I could probably do that
T:	okay the other things that need to be worked on over time certainly would be changing your eating habits you know to eat healthier not necessarily less but healthier and the other thing would be getting some more physical activity and by the way that doesn't mean going to a gym that means things like more walking maybe using stairs instead of an elevator or escalator stuff like that
C:	well she also mentioned the monitoring my blood sugar and all this and that just seemed like them mm-hmm a lot of and that's mumbo jumbo to me yeah
T:	that really is to give you feedback about how those other things are doing so that it keeps you on task
C:	oh okay
T:	so it helps you know that when you're taking your medicine when you're changing your eating habits that it's really having an impact than your blood sugar because getting your blood sugar down is gonna keep you from having all those other problems how does all this where does this leave you now right now in terms of how you're feeling
C:	well I like it that I you know that we can do it as stuff at the time I mean that's that relieves some pressure and being able to talk with you and do this as we go along rather than I I wasn't certain I could just wait and put this huge programming into effect but doing a step at a time and I you know that getting on the medicine I don't think that's any big problem like that I couldn't do
T:	sounds like you're very committed to that
C:	yeah I think I could do that as long as there's no big time side effects
