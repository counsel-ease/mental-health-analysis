T:	okay how can I help you
T:	see well I would just confirm for me your name again
T:	Oh like yes yes I brought you Reducto Reducto actually is no longer recommended and for usin in we lost weight control have you been getting on with it
C:	no not losing weight but I'm not putting it on and just give me another one there I'm not too fussy about which one it is
T:	me  you can buy em over the counter Laura doors lower doors tablets II don't need a prescription for them anymore
C:	no I'm sorry we can't prescribe orlistat
T:	why
C:	and because it's over-the-counter medicines right so just give me the equivalent that you prescribe
T:	we can't we can't prescribe anything reducta was the the one that was  was prescription on the medicine and we can no longer prescribe that guidance recommends that we no longer prescribe that for people because it's actually shown to increase the cardiovascular risk and actually I noticed from your last visit that your blood pressure was a little bit high I don't think you should be taking any medicines because the bottom line is actually from what you're telling me is it's not helping you to lose weight it's helping you to maintain your weight and maintaining your weight should be something that you do through diet and exercise anyway this is artificially maintaining your weight well it has actually been recent guidance over the last month or so 9 to 6 weeks tips sometimes tears I bet to filter through but we've been told unequivocally that we're not allowed to prescribe this anymore when you take your prescription to clap pharmacist they won't fill it and you really do need to be joining Weight Watchers there's been an article there's been an article in the in the BMG just a couple of weeks ago that shows that actually joining and group a Weight Watchers group or the equivalent it's much more effective long term well I'm sorry there's no choice it's a much it's much more because it's less there's less and drug in it it's less effective but then consequently it's also less dangerous so you can buy them or less stop and or you can join wheight Watchers I know I know and I can appreciate that but it's your diet and exercise that's the important thing you need to get yourself softer down well I think you might find that you possibly are eating more than you think and if you joined Weight Watchers or equivalent slimming world etc then you possibly would be encouraged to do a food diet  and you might find that you're eating more than you there's nothing more I can do for you we cannot prescribe Reducto anymore the recommendation is join a Weight Watchers group or Slimming World Group and just modify your diet and increase your exercise that is the only way that you are going to lose weight I'm really sorry that I'm unable to because there must be well that is the recommendation that's the guidelines if you're very welcome to go and make an appointment with another doctor but you will get the same message from them as you're getting from me and I'm sorry if I appeared on some pathetic however the bottom line is diet and exercise is what you need to do in order to lose weight and to maintain your weight
C:	just know that I'm getting middle-aged and piling on the pounds so if you're
T:	if you're doing what you've always done then you're always going to get what you get so if you already eat and you've all been back but the only reason that you're maintaining your weight is because of the deductr
C:	if you would let me finish I've only started to get fat so are you telling me that because I've had the menopause I'm not allowed to eat a normal amount of food
T:	no I'm saying that you need to be looking at your whole lifestyle which is diet and exercise I'm really sorry that I'm unable to help you today please feel free to make an appointment with another GP you
C:	i think i will i'm not satisfied
