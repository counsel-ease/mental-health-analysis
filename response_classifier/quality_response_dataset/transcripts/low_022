T:	all right Chris so I need to talk to you because as you know we have a zero-tolerance policy for drugs and alcohol at this school and as as athletic director it's my job to check in with our student athletes and make sure everyone's adhering to that rule and I've been hearing some chatter from some other kids about party this weekend and from what I hear where you were there and you know I can't confirm or deny anything so I'm not at the point where I can give you consequences but I do want to talk to you about whether or not you're drinking and how you know you really can't be doing this as a member of one of our teams
C:	all right actually I do want to speak to you about something to happen during this past weekend usually as you know I'm I'm gonna honor student I usually I'm studying over the weekend my parents to let me go out to parties but I kind of used that to my advantage to convince my parents to go to this party that my friends were pressuring me to go to and when I when I got there like I'm not used to this like party environment where everything you see in the movies is kind of what happens where you have people just drinking out of the bottle or playing random games with alcohol just to get drunk for no reason because I was there in the moment I felt pressured to do and conform to what everyone else was doing so I wouldn't beat him I wouldn't be ostracized
T:	yeah I get it like we've all been there okay you know I was in high school once - you know I drank - I get it there's not a ton to do in this town and kids drink but you know promise we have these rules and you're on a team you have to stick by the rules
C:	um I know that it's bad for me it's bad for my body it's bad for for for for being on the team for being an athlete it hinders my performance just I don't know I feel like my friends pressure me I don't know if I should like go with different fine groups maybe I don't know
T:	yeah Chris come on you're getting peer pressure
C:	I don't know like being in a sports team you feel very you have to like be unified with the group
T:	yeah well you're one of the leaders
C:	right and as being one of the leaders but my fellow teammates expect me to be excited expect them to lead not only in the sports but also in social environments and if that's social a social social custom in our society so
T:	maybe Panther leading as a non-drinker then I could but that could also backfire on me I feel that I could be ridiculed for being I mean stake up my butt you know
C:	you're a star player who's gonna pick on you
T:	I mean it's just one I'm just one person it's the
C:	all right well this is the mouth
T:	yeah so the issue again is I can't be hearing reports about you drinking I can't be hearing that you're at parties you can't be seeing pictures on Facebook you know there there are rules at this school and in my job I have to enforce them so you know like I said I get it you know I understand I know what it's like I get that you want to have fun you're teenagers I get that but you know you are a star player we want to keep you on the team you know we got to figure out a way to get through this
C:	well I'll dedicate the time not to party and like no not-not-not party but you get involved with alcohol to that extent and like have it publicized on the Internet
T:	what do you mean
C:	like on Facebook all the pictures that you saw him internet like I will avoid those situations where I have to go to a party where I feel pressured to actually drink alcohol and allow what I do in my own private time put on the internet so others can see even though
T:	all right yeah I mean we got to have a deal here if you're gonna be on the team okay
C:	right oh stop
T:	all right you promise all right shake all right we'll see you later
