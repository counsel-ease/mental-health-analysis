C:	okay so I'm really worried about my sister she's been hanging out
this:	boy and I read some lean and her diary about her and his boy
she's:	been hanging out with and I think they're like doing it
T:	and how does that make you feel
C:	well I already said I'm concerned about my sister
T:	and why are you concerned
C:	cuz I read her diary
T:	wait you read her diary why would you read her diary that is her
personal:	space
C:	well I was worried about her and she's been not hanging out their
friends:	cuz she's been hanging out with this boy
T:	well first of all if she was hanging out with this boy she wouldn't be
writing:	about it in her diary she'd be out there actually doing it and
if:	her friends aren't like actually hang out with her it's probably
because:	she's being all weird with them because she knows that her
friend:	likes this guy even though she likes this guy and it's just not
your:	business to go in her diary and do that
C:	but I was just really concerned about her
T:	oh

through:	her diary like that that's just so gross of you
C:	but I'd be like a bad sister if I'm not helping her if I don't know
what's:	wrong with her
