T:	I you know you don't have to sign up if you don't want to but you know I'm kind of here to like fix things for you and just make sure everything goes no real smoothly with the different issues that you've been having and just kind of oh you know kind of manage things and just take care of stuff so you know it's again if you want the service you can have it but it's kind of up to you but I am here if you want me to be and you know I'll couldn't kind of teach you about things you might not know about or tell you some things about your house and you know just Marlys make sure everything goes okay so you know you think that might be something you'd be interested in wanting to be a part of because I'd you know really like to help you
C:	okay well sure when you put it that way sure
T:	because it seems like I you know you've expressed some health issues lately and I know you've had a lot of problems with your weight so that's certainly something we can talk about and I know a lot about you know weight loss and have helped a lot of people with you know managing their weight and figuring out what they need to do so you know what are your main problems about your weight I mean why is it a problem for you
C:	um I eat too much you eat too much yeah
T:	so why do you eat too much I mean how is that a problem
C:	because whenever I'm stressed out about anything it makes me feel relaxed and calm
T:	so you like it you just like eating food so you just kind of eat more than you know you should be eating
C:	yes like do you know about portion control has anyone told you about like you know a card size for a piece of meat or some salad I mean have you has anyone showed you that cuz I can pull out our
T:	yeah yeah
C:	samples and give you those that I could probably tell you about it
T:	you could tell me about it I mean about what you should be eating for yeah meat size and like you know baseball size for fruit so it's not that you don't know about it you you you do know about poor lighting control
C:	yeah
T:	so if you know how much you should be eating and then how is it a means you know how much you should be eating then how do you stop
C:	well I guess you told me that you know a lot and you can fix my problem so that that's interesting I'm that's one of the reasons why I decided to participate so I was wondering if you could tell me
T:	well that's great I could do about this yeah because you know there's there's just so many different things when it comes to like weight loss you know and really being able to have some self-control I mean that's a really really important factor this is really being able to have some self-control and you know I found a lot of people just really need to increase their fruits and their vegetables and just not eat any processed foods and you know not eat any anything that might be kind of junk but then you know not not cheat either I mean you want to be able let yourself have some ice cream or some things that you might really like from time to time because you know you don't want to completely not let yourself have good stuff either so
C:	it sounds though that you're seeing some opposite things because when one moment you're saying not have any don't have any junk but then allow yourself ice cream once in a while so that would make it really confusing for me
T:	oh I see well you know obviously you want to make sure you're not eating you know junk food all day long but on the other hand you want to make sure that you give yourself some opportunities to have that bite of brownie or cake or you know I for myself personally I really love like lemon meringue pie so I always have to you know save that little piece for myself in the fridge to make sure I have my little bite of lemon meringue pie and then I can feel good about you know where I where I was eating good the rest of the day then I could still have my lemon meringue pie so something like that might kind of work better you know for you to really take a look at your portion sizes and then you know making sure you get out there and exercising me if you're not exercising that's certainly not going to help you with being able to get off the weight either so that's that's critical how are you doing on weight loss as far as exercising
C:	oh I haven't been exercising lately
T:	oh so see that's really key right that's a really key portion to it so it sounds like when we talk next time if you kind of kind of give me an idea maybe keep a journal for a week and tell me what you've been eating and we can really look at you know what good things that I can tell you what things you shouldn't be eating out of that plan and then I really think it'd be important if you just start maybe even just start walking three times a week if you could just start that really slowly and then you Muenster now we can kind of see if that's helped some and we can talk about the items you've had on your journal and we can go from there and all kind of direct you from there what you shouldn't be eating how does that sound
C:	well what does walking three times a week like for how long really like you know
T:	sure whatever whatever is comfortable for you so you know start out small so that you can feel really good about having some success and doing some exercise so you know if you feel tired at ten fifteen minutes really just kind of paste it along for yourself and feel what's right so that you can feel like you're getting out there and getting moving because it's all about taking a small step and you know at least getting active
C:	okay
T:	and then I think the flute journal would be really important because then we'll really have a better idea what you what you truly are eating and how many calories and then we can go from there and deciding you know how many calories you really should be eating in your diet and that way you can do a better job of monitoring it
C:	okay
T:	so how about we meet back and say three to four weeks and we can kind of see how that journal is going so
C:	that seems like a long time I mean I think in three to four weeks a lot of things can happen and I think these things
T:	yeah if you have any problems along the way before then feel free to give me a call I'm always available so if there is something that you find that's just not working just give me a call we can kind of discuss it but then we can meet in person because we really should probably have about a month of your journal you know kind of down but if there's something that comes up I mean by all means just give me a call there's my extension so you'll call me if you you know
C:	my weights been coming up so I think things will come up in a month
T:	yeah well I I would hope that with some you know with some exercise and with starting to be more aware by writing down what you eat you may find it as you have to write it down that you may find that you will avoid eating certain things because you don't want to you know as you write it down it may make you feel like well now I'm not so sure I should eat this like if you're gonna eat a whole container of ice cream you know you might not want to have to write that down so you may just limit yourself to a scoop or two of ice cream so there is some kind of pieces that help with having to write things down and I think we're just gonna take it step by step but again there's my phone and my extension so I'm here if you need me
C:	okay
T:	so let's just continue on our conversation that's so Tonya I'm really glad you were able to kind of come in and just talk with me for a couple minutes as I explained kind of briefly on the phone as part of your insurance benefit I'm available for you as your own personal coach you know I am a nurse but I have a lot of background in wellness so I've been really here to help guide people and kind of as a case manager I'm able to help you there help empower you don't kind of work towards your goals of what you're trying to work on with your health and I know you would express on the phone a little bit but I would love it if you tell me some more about you know what is one of maybe the main things you've been thinking about in relation to your health right now
C:	okay well basically I feel like if I don't if I don't stay on certain habits and routines then everything just kind of goes kaput
T:	so the structure is really important to you in your life in order to manage your house
C:	yeah I realize there's certain things I have to do in order to stay on on track yeah or else everything just kind of then I start noticing that I get into this whole this whole myriad of unhealthy unhealthy things I feel yucky basically
T:	so it almost sounds like a house of cards if one kind of shifts away from from that
C:	hmm
T:	they just kind of all fall down very quickly and then you start to not feel good about yourself or you don't start to feel good in general physically
C:	yeah I don't start field of it in general physically and then I you know I I yeah I can feel a change in my body and I just feel yucky because I'm then I end up not doing anything really
T:	oh okay so because you start feeling poorly or you started feeling badly then you just kind of say well whatever or
C:	yeah yeah it's kind of I move on and good habit reinforces on the so they build upon each other and it's sort of like if I don't have that collection of good habits then yeah I start to feel it because I'm not exercising and then I start to feel you know the fat come on and yeah
T:	for you it feels like this whole kind of circle of things almost the quickl you're not doing what you need to be doing then you start to feel a weight difference in your weight
C:	yeah
T:	so it just kind of builds on itself
C:	yeah
T:	so what do you see is the key goal that you're trying to focus on right now or maybe a group of goals what are what are your key things that you are wanting to have happen
C:	well I think just doing those things that do make me feel good you know tell me a little bit about those drinking water eating a certain amount of fruits and vegetables per day giving a certain amount of activity in per day and I was just thinking lately what's important to me is having one kind of thing that I do around physical activity that's social so I'm around other people and I realized that that makes a big difference to
T:	Oh social physical activity
C:	yeah
T:	that you get to be out and be with people like
C:	yeah j
T:	ust doing on your own right like even going to a gym and just being around other people working out we're going to some kind of exercise class just to be around other people who they're their general goal is to you know do physical tivity and feel better through it
C:	hmm so that you kind of feel like you're in a partnership together
T:	yeah
C:	that's rather than just you're wrong
T:	yeah
C:	yeah I'm working toward this together as a group
T:	yeah
C:	so you've talked about several different kind of pieces that are important to you if we just took a look at that one activity because that sounds like a newer thing that you're really trying to push with where would you put yourself on how important this is to you want to say on a scale of one to ten just just on importance
T:	yeah right now I realized that it would be this is just something I came to realization today so it would be about I think it's an eight
C:	Wow eight
T:	yeah it's really really up there
C:	yeah
T:	it's not a four or five right why would you say an eight not a four or five
C:	because I that it's a it is important for me to have social interaction and be around people who are doing like I guess you'd say like-minded like-minded things and then it becomes less just about me and more about you know just sharing
T:	oh okay it's about sharing there's that yeah really that piece of connectedness that's really important for you
C:	yeah
T:	so if we were to ask your second question and that's kind of where the rubber meets the road how confident are you that you could start finding a group activity let's say in the next two weeks
C:	oh
T:	you could start one obviously you've got steps to find it
C:	right
T:	involved but within two weeks you could find yourself in some type of a group activity
C:	two weeks seems reasonable I think I can do it within two weeks so I would give that a eight
T:	so you would get that in ages yeah so it's something that's pretty important to you
C:	yeah
T:	definitely more than a six or seven and also you're really confident that you can go out there and do that
C:	yeah
T:	what do you see as some of the barriers that might get in your way
C:	um I guess just structuring my time better
T:	structuring your day better
C:	yes yes so really not slacking off and really not saying okay well I'm tired you know now tonight I'll just wait till tomorrow basically that
T:	so finding the time in your day
C:	yeah
T:	able to do or not do this or not
C:	yeah
T:	and how do you see that best in your day how do you see that working in like an evening kind of thing or
C:	the evening yeah yeah right now the way the way just my today is structured with what I need to do in terms of um work and other commitments
T:	okay
C:	evening yeah
T:	so one of the things I hear people frequently will be saying is that the evenings my time to unwind and then I don't have the energy or I don't feel like going out to do something that might be more rigorous how is that for you
C:	I think that would be that would be okay I could always have a cup of coffee beforehand
T:	you can always have a cup of coffee
C:	yes yes
T:	well it would be okay with you I would to touch base maybe after that class starts and just kind of see what you found how it's working and then we can go from there looking at any kind of barriers the one thing I think I would just encourage you with to normalize is to realize about doing things in small doable steps and not feeling like if you haven't done everything for the day that you're
C:	right
T:	the day but but that anymore water you drink or vegetables you've added it's certainly a positive and looking at trend
C:	right
T:	then to be hard on yourself right towards your you know movement toward wellness
C:	right
T:	okay so if we could touch base maybe in three weeks
C:	sure
T:	that would be super I'd really look forward to it I'm really glad you came in
C:	okay thank you
