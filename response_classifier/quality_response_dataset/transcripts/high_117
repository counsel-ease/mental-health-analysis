T:	hi William I'm Heather I'm so glad to meet you 
T:	hi Heather thanks for coming in sure how was your trip over 
C:	it was okay i had trouble finding the place at first
T:	but you know first time coming here you made it I made it right fantastic and it looks like you brought some paperwork with you  C 	and I didn't I filled out the form 
T:	thank you for all of that how was all that for you it's a lot of papers a lot to fill out 
C:	I I wasn't sure on some of it what to put down so I'm hoping you'll help me with that 
T:	fantastic well thanks so much for going through all of that e note was a lot to ask and I'm so glad that you're here and that you made it and we can most certainly go through any of that that would be useful for you today okay and I'm wondering if maybe at first before we get started I'd like to check in with you and just see if there's any questions things that you've been thinking about or wondering about since you first heard about our program that might have brought you here might be on your mind 
C:	um-hmm that's a good question well I not really I know a little bit about the program actually because I was a client about seven or eight years ago and didn't really things didn't turn out well so I'm interested to know how things might be different and I'm I'm just not sure I'm just not sure with my situation if you can help me out or not 
T:	sure so you're back with us again and thinking about gosh this time might be different for you and may be wondering what that might look like 
C:	I hope so yeah yeah 
T:	anything else that might be on your mind or even thinking about or wandering about?
C:	well I have I don't know if I'm getting ahead of myself or not but I have a little bit of a record for some misdemeanors when I used to drink and so I'm I just really feel like I'm not good for much I don't know who would want me for it to work 
T:	so they're really wondering right now if if if work is possible for you
C:	yeah 
T:	do you think it is well I hope that through our work together you'll be able to decide that for yourself hmm and my hope in our process is that that we could be partners and thinking about that together and what what work might look like for you in your life and how it might fit in for you how does that sound 
C:	okay I thought you might just tell me what to do and I had to do it I'm so this okay I'm I'm ready like I can do that 
T:	so thinking about for yourself what you know could be possible is almost a new thought for you right now 
C:	it is usually when I'm at home I'm pretty depressed and thinking this is the rest of my life and it's not something I'm it just doesn't make me happy when I think of it like that so to think there might be alternatives or choices interesting i'm not sure what to do with that
T:	honestly and something brought you here today it did 
C:	yeah 
T:	what was it that made you decide even with all of that sort of thinking about at home?
C:	i'm not sure if this is possible or this this may not work out for me 
T:	and yet there was something that brought you here 
C:	well I consider my chair all day and watch TV shows I get to watch the old days and its really nostalgic and I'm in my mid  so I'm thinking I could be doing this for another  or  years is that really okay for me my son is he's an adult he still lives with me but he's he's capable taking care of himself and I just can't imagine myself sitting in this chair for the next  years and just deteriorating and I don't think I would last  years i think i would ask maybe eight and I'm not ready to go 
T:	so there was a moment in time when you were sitting in your chair watching your oldies that you thought is this what the rest of my life will be like em hmm will there be something you know that be something more and also you know it's part of the time it's like yeah this is it you know you made your bed be happy with it and this is this is all there is in that's it then this other part is not too sure if that's okay 
C:	you know I'm not really sure I want to be there yeah not as comfortable but then the end then there's a third voice that says he can't do anything and so it's just like I just feel really confused and kind of tied up in knots and I thought well I'll give you our try again it can't hurt I might get mad but why not 
T:	well I'm really glad you're here William and I look forward to finding out much more about what it is that's most important to you and what you want your life to be like in it in the future and you do know what's best for yourself you have those voices that you said that tell you what you do like and what works for you and and the voice that sort of says I'm not sure that this is what's best for me you have a lot of things kind of rolling around in your 
C:	I do it's an just spins around in there it's really really hard sometimes yeah how exhausting that must feel mmhmm yeah and confusing and aggravating and depressing and anxiety-provoking and just all of that honestly it was kind of hard to come in here because I just like I'm feeling kind of hopeless about the whole situation so um but I like I said I just thought I can't hurt and even just talking about it in this moment
T:	I noticed that you got a little tense and sort of it's almost like those wheels are turning again just considering it as the coaches are tracking 
C:	it is I just think I'm i don't know i feel kind of dumb it's just like what am i what do i think i'm doing but i'll try not to be negative i'll try to think more positive it's just kind of a habit 
T:	I guess and you have some hope for your future that things can be different for you I hope so I'm sure what that looks like yet don't know what it looks like 
C:	yeah 
T:	so what do you think if the two of us together um could potentially start exploring that journey a little bit some of the things you mentioned just in our brief interaction right now have been that you that you have a son that lives with you that is really doing okay and so you're able to start thinking about yourself in your life and that maybe you're a little concerned about what the future might bring and what some of the things in your life that you're dealing with your criminal history for instance might potentially get in your way and how could you how could you get around that what life could you have for yourself at home it's more than sitting in that easy chair watching your oldies mhm so if we may be delved into a bit more of that sort of what you're thinking about working how does 
C:	that sound sounds really good I I haven't worked for  years and or maybe eight but it's been a long time and things have changed so much I just know it won't be easy but I'm ready for that you seem like a pretty nice person to talk to so I'll give it a try 
T:	you're ready to at least explore it huh so um would this be a good time for me to share a little bit maybe about how our program might have changed from the last time 
C:	sure I'd yes please 
T:	so how I see things is that I sort of feel like maybe a guide or a partner with you in your journey towards work in thinking about work from where you are now maybe feeling a little bit confused or not sure about what the future may bring and then to bringing you forward to however that looks for you in your life and hopefully to that place where you really want to be where you're doing something that that fits for you and feels good and that we it as a program have some resources that we could potentially utilize together our first step would be of course today to take your application for services and then after that I would be able to look at whether or not you're eligible to work together on this journey and if so we would be able to figure that out together what that path looks like so how does that sound to you?
C:	it sounds pretty good I'm how long does this take 
T:	that's a great question so you really you really want to know what the path forward might look like yeah what to expect what to expect 
C:	yeah I really like to know what to expect that's important to me and everyone's journey is different working 
T:	oh you and I together can potentially plan that mm-hmm we can talk about there are certainly certain time frames in our program around eligibility our first step is the application and then we have some time frames and together our hope is that we can even improve on those time frame um so I guess it's kind of a wait and see well know when it happens how long it takes absolutely but the first step is just to get started and how about if we along the way maybe kind of check in with each other around expectations and time frames would that be useful?
C:	hmm mm-hmm thanks 
T:	yeah yeah totally so if you'd like to get started would you mind if I take a look at your application paperwork and just make sure that there isn't anything that I may have a question about 
C:	okay thank you very much for bringing fun like I said I
