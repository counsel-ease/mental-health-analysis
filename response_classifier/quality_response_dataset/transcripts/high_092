T:	good morning Jenny thank you for coming in again how have you been doing since the last time we met 
C:	doing good doing good just you know work the kitty stroll last night  tricks um then I saw my man one of these other girls were skimming off the top and he beat her up good and I i just decided come in here cuz you know the money wasn't so good last night but a lot better than working for mcdonalds right 
T:	yeah so you you saw your without your boyfriend beating up another girl 
C:	yeah my man was beating up another girl she works for him too okay
T:	so what what do you think happened there
C:	right she was just stupid she was skimming off the top and you know at least be smart about it charges the john like a couple extra dollars and do it that way but she was like doing it based regular price and she got caught she didn't meet her quota 
T:	okay so how do you feel about that how how do you feel about he'll be up and in front of you 
C:	oh I mean he gotta do what he gotta do but I it was it was weird because it was right in front of me and these other girls and he beat her up really badly like even more than just like like a couple dollars was worth as if like she been doing it for a long time but I don't think so cuz he would have been in there up Oh like when it started just saw it i mean her face is pretty messed up so she got their ass tonight 
T:	so it sounds like it affected you to witness stuff 
C:	yeah yeah i guess so i mean it's it's scary know like your you're just out there and you're working and he's supposed to protect you because I mean we got the dual system kind of like me and this other girl we make sure we check in oh but I mean we can still get attacked by johns and stuff like it's it's like a part of the job I mean we make pretty good money but working on the kitty stroll would word like we have to take care of each other and then he's supposed to take care of us so when he reprimands this is kind of like it's just another thing no it's another like like he could just told her not to do it again but i don't know i mean he's running a business whatever it's his business but it's just scary just just thinking about it like he could have done that to me and maybe i would have even gotten worse 
T:	wow so you afraid that he might do that to you and you you kind of view him viewed him in the past or until last night as a protector so you afraid that he might do that to you also
C:	I mean it's not like it's not like I haven't seen him beat up other girls I mean but usually it's not that bad you know it's like host maxim went down poncho anything like that but then he was really beating her up to a point where like like her whole face was swollen purple black I don't know but I mean it's not like she was the first one ever like skim off the top but I guess she got Kai 
T:	so he's getting out of control he's getting out of control
C:	I think so if I mean it never saw him like that before and I mean I don't want to be receiving and you know am I not pretty faith then that mean I can't work
T:	so you are afraid for your life you're afraid that he might do it to you sooner than later 
C:	yeah I'm definitely scared about that happening um I just don't know what to do i mean i can't i can't make the same money on a regular part-time full-time job you know like i can make easily five hundred dollars a night at the control then to be like making nine dollars an hour whatever minimum wage is at i don't know a store doing merchandise or whatever also we selling stuff but i won't be making good enough money 
T:	ok so I'm so what I'm hearing is that you you are starting to be afraid of your man yeah and you are tired of witnessing all this abuse happening and you would like to to try something else maybe work out a store but you're not sure if the money will be enough because you're not used to making you know just minimum wage and you are you're not sure you're not sure if you want to leave that life but you are afraid you're afraid for yourself 
C:	yeah and I even dropped our high school because you know what am i what am I going to do with books and stuff when I'm making a  night at most unless it was a slow night but soul night or whatever just like what what we need college for what do I need school for I don't need a diploma I mean I mean not even that's mine so why am I going with my time because as time goes on like we grow older we like lose our beauty and everything so I might as well just use whatever I can out fucking school I guess i'll go later whatever else or even need it but i don't i don't want to be like wasting my time I got a job that I'm not gonna like I mean not that like this one but at least it's like let's work for more money ok so
T:	it's important to you that you make a certain amount of money to support yourself 
C:	yeah okay sure I don't want to like have to like worry about Oh am I gonna pay my phone bill or oh I like that purse but I can't afford it I want that i want to make good money now ok but then again like getting her Oh sometimes raped it's just just too much
T:	so it's so on one hand it's it's important to you that you have nice things that you make a certain amount of money but then the other you don't want to continue risking your life this ways that that's what I'm hearing that you don't want to continue with this lifestyle you feel like it's getting out of hand as far as the violence 
C:	I mean this is only like I've been working since I was  so this is only thing that I know I don't know how to do anything else flip burgers whatever you know I I by mcdonalds I don't sell McDonald's 
T:	ok so it's it's it seems like you you would like to do something different but it is a particular type of job you would like to do and the type of money you would like to make 
C:	and but but I mean what kind of job is that makes us good money there's not that many jobs and not that many jobs I mean right there so it's like like I don't know it's just 
T:	so you feel like you're not you're not smart enough good enough to try something different 
C:	yeah I don't feel smart enough to do that to like change like what i've been doing this is all I know so it's it's all I can do I mean I wish I could do something else but what can i do that i mean what's the references i'm gonna do oh I've been doing from this to this you know working the streets no one's gonna hire me no no one's going to give me like a chance no one's gonna go oh she dropped out of high school and and then start working the streets let's give her a job 
T:	yeah so you would like to try something different you would like to maybe try a different type of work but you're afraid that people will not give you a chance and they will judge you based on on the fact that you dropped out of high school and you've been working the streets and so you're afraid that maybe people will not see that you you are smart and and you want things in life and coming in here and speaking about it is a good thing you know and no and understanding that maybe I can try something different is a good thing you know it's it's it takes courage and and you afraid that people will not see that in you 
C:	yeah ah I just want them you know what I just want to be able to be doing what I do without fear though cuz i don't mind like I don't care what I do I'm whatever about it I mean this someone has to do it you know if we had like no prostitution I don't think was like I don't think politicians we get their rocks off ah but yeah like I wouldn't mind doing what I'm doing but I don't want like that the things that that happened to girls all the time I don't want to get breathe in I don't want get a choked or whatever okay 
T:	so you would you would rather a safe place that you don't mind what you're doing but you you you you would like for it to be a little safer for you and 
C:	yeah but that's that's like that's like utopia want wanting something or whatever that is whatever utopia is it's like peace or something I had wanted John talking about it I was like what no crime so use 
T:	these things like you you know you you want you you don't mind the job in one way but you afraid for your life and you also want to try something different like you want to do to show the world that you can you know you can do other things and you you know even though you dropped out of high school you can have another job but at the same time having a certain type of the money making a certain type of money is important to you and having nice things on point 
C:	I mean I can't go into college without like a GED or anything like that so I don't know I mean cause you spent like is expensive so now we have like a place i'm living at right now i live with my man okay so do some most like the other girls too we can't put like we can't be applying for college applications and then having male go to the house that would be weird i think i think i might get beaten up for that 
T:	okay so you can't you can't do anything as far as for yourself like you can't apply for school i'm leaving there
C:	no no if if he thinks that we're going to be leaving I think I'll get worse than beating up I think might get killed okay
T:	so you would write you would you would like to apply for college but you afraid that you might get killed if your man finds out that you are applying for college so it seems like it means something to you that you you continue your education 
C:	yeah I mean there's only so many options for me to do and that the only option right now seems like I gotta keep working the streets cuz I don't got a house I don't you know have anything that belongs to me like it like per se I mean I guess everything's like all the girls we share like everything all the clothes um yeah we we sometimes sleep in the same room okay but we're in the same house and I don't know like I don't think I can afford moving out by myself okay 
T:	so one day you would like to move out but you don't think it can work out right now as far as your living situation 
C:	I mean I don't think I got many options and I don't I don't see the opportunities like around I mean like if you if you think about it I'm I'm stuck maybe if I was like back at  if someone stopped it from happening then maybe I've had a chance but no 
T:	okay okay so what I'm hearing is that you know you would like to try something different you would wrap you would like to go to college but you are afraid to even apply for to go to college because you don't want your man to find out you know you you feel like you can do something better with your life but the opportunities or not you don't feel like the opportunities are there for you right now but but glad that you are you know you come here and you talk about it it's encouraging and it'd take a lot of you know stress to do that and I thank you for coming today and and we will resume next week and and thank you for coming it takes a lot of courage thank you thank you
