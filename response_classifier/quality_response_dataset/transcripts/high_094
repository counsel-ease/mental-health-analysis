T:	hi this Bravo I'm hear it and I'm nurse practitioner today how are you doing not that great I could be better Foreman seen here today 
C:	oh I'm just not feeling well I just feel dizzy a lot mm-hmm well
T:	I noticed from your previous physical exam couple days ago that your blood pressure seems to be a little bit high it was around  over  and I was wondering how you are managing this blood pressure or are you aware of your hypertension 
C:	yeah I'm aware that I have hypertension but I don't really measure my blood pressure every day but now that what that you mentioned what my blood pressure is I do have concerns 
T:	okay well thank you for seeing me today I understand that you have concerns about your blood pressure can you please tell me more about it 
C:	well to tell you the truth I'm not really taking my water pills every day because it makes me pee a lot and I don't like it and nobody told me about the side effects of this medication that's why I don't like taking it I'm not really sure if it's making my blood pressure better because I don't feel any difference also sometimes I forget to take my medication since I live by myself and nobody is there to remind me I really want to manage my blood pressure I know I can do it but I just need help 
T:	okay it seems to me that you're really concerned about your blood pressure and that you are willing to change if I'm understanding this correctly you are not aware of any side effects of your medication and your water pill makes you go to the washroom a lot which makes you not want to take your medication even more also you mentioned that you are living alone and so you tend to forget your pills and you would want some help to remember that is this correct 
C:	yeah that's correct okay
T:	well thank you for sharing this information with me and for your honesty since both of us are aware that this is an issue would it be okay to talk about your hypertension and what it means to you yeah okay to start would you mind describing some at disadvantages of your hypertension so that we can see you may have 
C:	well first of all all I know that hypertension is when you're have a really high blood pressure and it can lead to me suffering a stroke or heart attack and cause that the doctor prescribed me this may six to manage my hypertension but I have no idea how it works and what can be the possible side effects of this medication it's also a challenge to maintain a healthy diet because I live alone and I can't go to go grocery shopping and cook for myself because it's tiring to cook for yourself and i'm already  years old and i'm having difficulty finding motivation to exercise but the most challenging part of having hypertension is not being able to take the medications every day consistently I know what I have to do I just need someone to help you learn how to do it 
T:	okay well I just shut down some of the concerns that you mentioned just so super clear that we have it here and it seems to me that your biggest concern is your medication adherence and that is pretty much affecting like your daily activities such as going to get exercise or preparing a meal is this right yeah that's right okay now that we've identified some of the challenges we cannot can we please identify some of the advantages of you take your medication properly 
C:	well the advantage is that this medication can help me manage my blood pressure since you've been formed me that my current blood pressure right now is  over  and I'm aware that that is high and I can still live a normal life such as play with my grandkids and being able to exercise without experiencing any headaches or dizziness I'm able to prevent myself from developing a stroke so basically more chances of me living longer and healthy 
T:	okay that's awesome um when it comes to the importance of you taking your medication on a scale from  to   being unimportant  the most important how important is it to you for you to take this medication 
C:	well it's very important to me so it's a  out of  because I really want to manage my blood pressure every day and I want to live a healthier life 
T:	now that this issue is very important to you I would like to know how confident you are in achieving this goal so again on a scale from  to   King unconfident and  the most confident how confident are you that you are able to take your medication regularly 
C:	well I would say about a vibe of  because it's difficult for me to take this medication because of the side effects that I always experience with it
T:	ok what would it take for you to go from an  or above or even a  out of  for your confidence 
C:	may be constant follow up and support support from family regarding managing my hypertension to help me adhere with my medications regularly 
T:	ok thank you for that let me see if I'm understanding this correctly you're aware that you have hypertension and you truly want to manage your blood pressure but you're unable to do so because there are certain challenges that you face such as you can diet for getting your pills regularly not being able to monitor your blood pressure but this leads you to not seeing the full effect of the medication itself however you are so confident that you're able to change by let's say going to a followup with me or having support from your families or friends am I
C:	yeah that's right you mentioned all the information I discussed 
T:	ok it seems like you are willing to change your behavior and at the same time you are frustrated about not getting the medication that you need for you to change or support that you need to change am I is a spread
C:	yeah that's right it's frustrating not getting enough support but after talking with you I feel more relieved that I can get the support than I need it 
T:	ok do you have any ideas on how to achieve this goal 
C:	may be changing the type of medications I'm taking right now because I don't like living with the side effects of it ok and getting more information regarding about the side effects of this lasix and how it's affecting my body and maybe by pill containers to track of my everyday medication so I don't miss any dosage also I should learn how to monitor my blood pressure using the machines to make sure the medication is working well ok and maybe i will go to a clinic near my area to monitor my blood pressure ok
T:	um I'm wondering if you are able to or you'll be open to your monitoring your blood pressure for the safe and next couple of months um just monitoring and see if that side effects are there or if it's working for you this way we can evaluate whether the medication is right for you this time this is ok 
C:	you know that's fine and I also want to have a personal diary to monitor my blood pressure regularly oh that's what's like a great plan that can actually work 
T:	if you want I can give you some information about like new medications and if you have any questions don't hesitate to give me a call also for the next appointment that we're going to have if you can bring your your diary where you write your blood pressure down we can see and track down how is the medication is for you is there anything else I can do for you 
C:	no that's all I feel more relieved now that I talk to you and I'm looking forward to our meeting next week okay well thank you so much for openness and honesty i hope this speaker will be better for you and I will see you in a next appointment
