C:	after all that crying poor guy yeah well  
T:	the good news is he doesn't have pneumonia it's just an upper respiratory tract infection a cold so there's some things you can do to make to help him get better you can avoid excessive dust you can keep them hydrated avoid over-the-counter cold remedies keep them away from people who have flu or cold like symptoms and avoid smoke and the last one should be easy because you quit smoking during your pregnancy 
C:	wellyou're right I did quit smoking when I was pregnant but actually a couple weeks ago I went out my mom was able to take Jake for the night and my friends they were having a birthday party and we had a couple glasses of wine and felt like old times so before I knew it I was out having a cigarette with them and since then I've been having couple cigarettes a day you don't just at the end of the day after I put Jake to bed but that sounds like it has nothing to do with what you're talking about right?  
T:	no wait a minute that has everything to do with what we're talking about I can't believe at the end of this appointment you're just slipping in the fact that you've resumed smoking again that's very very important information for me to know and I'd like to spend some time talking about it now  
C:	well I had no idea that it was such a big deal I didn't think it would have anything to do with Jake getting sick or you know hurting him  
T:	come on Haley you're here because you thought he had pneumonia you're telling me that Jake can't breathe your concern about is breathing and then you just slip in the fact that you're smoking cigarettes and you think there's no relationship? do I really need to review all the risks of smoking in front of your child or exposing him to secondhand smoke not to mention the risk that you're posing to yourself and your own health  
C:	well you know I was doing perfectly well it was just when I went out with my friends and you know usually I'm fine with the cravings it's just when I have a glass of wine at the end of the day and if I have more than two or three I just get that craving for cigarette and five cigarettes in the house it just happens you know I'm doing pretty good  
T:	so it sounds like if you have alcohol then smoking is very difficult to avoid and you know what you need to do you need to go home and as your your son's doctor I need to tell you you need to go home and throw cigarettes you need to quit  
C:	okay well yeah I guess I can throw the cigarettes and tomorrow night when I have my glass of wine we'll just try to avoid that craving  
T:	and let's talk some more about wine you keep throwing wine into the conversation it sounds like it's become a significant part of your daily routine how much are you drinking? 
C:	only a couple of drinks a night you know it's pretty rare if I have anything more than that it's just my way of relaxing at the end of the day it's been so stressful since Jake came along it's just how I fall asleep at the end of the night  
T:	well no one says motherhood was going to be easy Harry so let's talk about these drinks are we talking about the low risk drinking guidelines one to two standard drinks a night? are we talking about a muggle margaritas? 
C:	well  
T:	what are you drinking? what's the quantity that you're drinking?  
C:	I guess I have about a half a glass a night and maybe two very rarely I'll have more than that you know it just helps me kind of relax  
T:	there's other ways to reiax there's yoga there's deep breathing you need to stop raising the roof and raise your kid this is not okay you're not just worrying about hailey anymore it's Hailey and Jake you're a mom now  
C:	I didn't know it was such a big deal I'd never thought it there would be any impact on Jake because of it  
T:	I'm trying not to be hard on you hailey but I've got to tell you as a physician it's a very big deal your drinking and your tobacco use are red flakes for me and they need to stop immediately so we've already talked about your plan for smoking you're going home you're throwing out your cigarette you're putting on the patches what's the plan for the alcohol? 
C:	I guess we'll do the same thing I'll go home and throw out the bottles of wine and stop having a glass at the end of the day  
T:	sounds good and if you need to relax go for a walk join a moms group read a book how about you come back in a week when we have Jake six-month checkup and you can let me know how that quit plans going? 
C:	okay I'll try my best  
T:	Thanks
