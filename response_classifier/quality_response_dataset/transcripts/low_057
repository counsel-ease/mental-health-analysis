T:	just fine so um we'll keep an eye on the stomach problems that you described today and as soon as your lab tests come back will our office will be in touch with you 
C:	okay 
T:	I did notice that you filled out our alcohol questionnaire so we'll need to go over that before you leave let me just verify some information real quick what is it that you typically drink?
C:	just beer regular beer just beer 
T:	so a standard  ounces as standard can or bottle that's what you're drinking how many days a week are you drinking?
C:	I guess about three on average 
T:	about three days a week and how many beers on the days that you drink? C	usually four or five maybe a six pack T	okay so up to six drinks on the days that you're drinking about three days a week 
C:	yeah 
T:	so based on that information that you've told me and then looking over your questionnaire here have to tell you for a man your age you're in a high-risk category really for Falls accidents other health problems that sort of thing developing in relation to your drinking what do you think about that?
C:	well I wasn't aware of that I don't drink that much I like drinking with my friends and on the weekends at home at some of my friends really do have a problem with drinking but I don't think I do 
T:	well in my professional opinion you're really not too far behind your friends if you say that they're having some problems you've come in today complaining about the stomach problems and unless you're willing to quit or at least cut back those problems are bound to just get worse so what are your thoughts about that?
C:	I don't know what to think about that this is news to me I think I just need a pill for the indigestion could you just give me one of those purple pills 
T:	mr. Wilson I could just give you a prescription and send you on your way but again unless you're willing to change your alcohol drinking so quitting would be optimum but at least cutting back the chances or you'll end up back here and we'll just be having the same conversation again 
C:	okay well just give me the prescription and I think I'll be fine 
T	okay 
C	Thank you
