T:	okay hi there hello my name is Michael Biehn and i am a chemical dependency counselor here at active recovery what's your name down below pinch be okay and that's what we know is that spelled because according to this we have our pick work here that we have it done this is Donald Augustine you preferred honor Donald preferred on that's both aug  aug e and s T is T I make sure yes make sure we get that corrected okay basically today this is this this is an initial intake session we want to kind of determine some of your needs and what ultimately brought you brought you herVI received a call this week from your general care practitioner and your neighbor he was concerned but before he was concerned mainly about prescription medication use but before we get get into actually be more interested in getting a little bit 
C:	of course I came to the doctor because I was trying to clean these strokes and ladder fell down and I I'm kind of back hurt pretty bad was that a little bit how long ago was that it's been a fun month a month ago 
T:	okay okay how are you go if I start on how you're  you look really healthy good very healthy Bush won last year why yes sure are you do you have a family are you married 
C:	I'm married  years  years 
T:	when they did here is ready are they doing that you think you've ever say it better as you go along how many children 
C:	yes and I told buddy my wife is it's six  donors that's that's pretty big as a lot of that's big that's bigger than most people today  grandchildren  six great-grandchildren one month away 
T:	yeah wow that's that's that's quite a quitter we're going to turn gotta try to hold those nation there that's good that's really are you retired 
C:	yes sir sort of our agreement 
T:	where you've been working most of your life 
C:	I've worked in a lot of things if Undertaker in the MTO ambulance assistant manager bookstore work for radio shack or plan jack of all trades almost maybe not maybe master 
T:	yeah I bet you have a lot of life experience it's it's been interesting that's great it's great so tell me about your troubles with her
C:	back first you know in the daytime when I could move around it's not as bad I still have to take medication but at night is very good at night I can't sleep I wake up a lot it's very hard to be comfortable at night 
T:	so moving around seems to help you have less pain it's but when you're sleeping at night or you're staying in one place you have more pain 
C:	I think so 
T:	okay how does the prescription medication fit into your lifestyle right now those last one I see here that you have your taking oxycontin or the taking oxycodone pushes a generic brand new do you realize that's an opiate it's the same this is a painkiller it's similar to what how that a coat of opium is the same thing got an opiate they would make similar to heroin and a lot of people take opiates different kinds of paint further pain medication problems and they hurt their back or they have injuries do you realize that it's highly addictive 
C:	it can be we'll just take it I get to hurt they tell me that you can only take it every four hours I can't wait that long 
T:	yeah it's uh it sounds to me I mean how long how often you take are you taking it is you you're taking it as prescribed is that correct what should ignore your daytime and i can't wait them and say you take you find yourself more you've been finding yourself taking work how much is that increase over the last last one half 
C:	as long as shit there Toby vision 
T:	okay and have you talked to your doctor about possibly increasing the dosage what you doesn't want to do that so I hadn't go to their doctor to get you more 
C:	ok 
T:	so now you're seeing two doctors to work with the pain medication right for your back 
C:	yes 
T:	and that's so that you can get more is that because the first doctor won't give you communi give you enough ok and he gave you as prescribed in the beginning a specific amount and if he go he did he did well he gave you a specific amount and he's not willing to go any further good woman they could okay and so but you felt that you needed to get more difficult Lee okay so you went to a second doctor together to get more okay I'm just trying to clarify to make sure that i understanding correctly has heaven do you know what tolerances loaded with black people no tolerance is and when it comes to medications and drugs and alcohol so when a person would take a certain amount of medication or they might take a certain drug or they might drink a certain amount and they would continue to increase the amount and as time went on their body could only take so what their body kit would want more it's like creating one more and more and over the last month how many times have you increased your medication we could really keep track Tyler to the right foot listen let's narrow it down 
C:	maybe over last week or I can't I your only lasts about two hours to latch run into some flashes 
T:	okay so it it's only lasting two hours and it's posted last hour motion much hold for four hours of time but it's only lasting two hours and then you're taking more increasingly and so your date or how many times have you increase that dosage on your own couple times 
C:	I suppose
T:	okay 
C:	so how how much should be taking her per day now as opposed to its prescribed every four hours 
T:	so you should you should take it every four hours and you've taken it took it over to every two hours and how many pills to build two pills so technically you're supposed to take it every four hours so in a -hour period you're taking it about five times or six times maybe and what you were you were prescribed to Kazakhstan 
C:	right 
T:	okay and sat down and now you're taking it a total of twelve times ouch 
C:	okay 
T:	and that's over a month period 
C:	okay 
T:	all right it sounds can I make a suggestion or can I give you a little bit of feedback it sounds to me like it is that you're increasing that you've increased your tolerance because of the amount of pain that you're having you've increased your increasing a tolerance level for the medication handle so much medication and you're building up a tolerance now for it that's the beginning stages of addiction and I wouldn't say that you're in too bad a shape at this point or anything but what concerns me is that you are increasing your amounts of medication regularly you're seeing a second doctor to get more deep do you see a problem or discrepancy with my backers 
C:	okay
T:	so you're a problem 
C:	okay
T:	all right you you have taken medication that you took over the prescription hands against your doctors for or orders on them and then you saw a second doctor to get the second amount medication you're building up a tolerance and a resistance to the medication if you continue to take the medication at this rate where do you think you'll be in the next  days okay right now you're taking medication at a rate of taking you started off with one let's take two pills okay originally at your six times a day every four hours I believe I'm doing my math right 
C:	okay 
T:	and you increase you doubled that in at one stunna against the wishes of your first doctor and you spoke to a second doctor is your first doctor note about the second doctor what about the second doctor so they don't know each other they don't know ok so that's a problem in a bits out there that 
C:	I don't I know
T:	it's because you're you're in pain but you can crease your mouth over this last month if you continue on this trajectory continue moving forward doing what you're doing right now I month down the road where do you think medication intake is going to be super trippy you'd probably be double introduced no double what is now you see a problem with that sounds like at this point right now you're you're you're you're lucky because you're very very early in the stage statements
C:	okay 
T:	but if you continue forward with it it can become an increasingly highly addictive problem and you would you would need a formal treatment inpatient treatment at this point you that's not necessary impatient Rick we what we would need to do is determine boy or like for us both determine what we could do to manage the pain slow down the amount of medication you're taking before 
C:	okay 
T:	would you well first of all first thing I would like that is on it at this point right there on the scale  to   being least important  being most highly important where where do you see yourself right now as high as important as this how important is it for you to change your current path help with that quick pretty close for joining a time 
C:	okay eight or nine 
T:	okay would you would you be interested in possible pain they're seeing that they're just because I I can refer you to a therapist that helps with pain management it's not medication base it wouldn't take you off your current medications that would help you manage your pain better through several techniques and therapies it's relatively low cost and expensive and the money that you'd be spending to increase your medication you actually be saving by seeing the pain being retired doctor yeah and that way you would have to see two doctors regularly but you can't do some a management as well let me ask you another question on a scale another scale scale of  to  on confidence level how confident do you feel that that you could get some help and change this district
C:	that wouldn't be as high because my back hurt 
T:	yeah it hurts all the time so that makes you look pretty that would be a more under scale so a little bit lower on the scale okay so because your back you think your your back let's talk about that a little bit just for a moment here when you're hurting and your back is hurting tremendously what's besides trying to relieve the pain let's really what's what's going on through your mind well you can never get relief with these lay down or sit down or stand up it hurts all the time hurts a little less when I'm moving around when I'm still more contrary it bothers more right now just having to sit here that's all I nobody tell you about it so do you would you do you want to we talked about you want to consider  shortly then what we want to do is make it would you like to make a goal and follow up about it about a week or so perhaps make a smart home real like what we could do is one have a specific color plan perhaps maybe see I'll refer you to my my reps is verb for pain management specialist do you think you could what's a good time you could probably make an appointment to see him probably tuesday or thursday tuesday or thursday 
C:	okay 
T:	what's a good time you can come in and see me again  that's weak do you think you can add it in gate you cook 
C:	okay 
T:	do you think maybe tuesday you can see the pain specialist and management specialists and then maybe CD on thursday just follow just to show check in see how you're progressing 
C:	okay
T:	Zack seem attainable an attainable goal for you so far ok and then so we kind of boiled that down so it's actually going to be time times of actually the soul what time on thursday time Jepsen afternoon two o'clock in two o'clock
C:	okay 
T:	I think that you I mean it still looks like talking to you you I know that you something kind of summing it up everything you didn't at first you didn't see the direction that your pain medication might be taking you in but now you clearly see that it could take you in this direction that could really be harmful to do good okay and that's the pain management might be a better alternative coming coming together with the medication and in a piglet pain medicine and actually is some sort of treatment therapy kind of work on some ideas to try to help you sunny weather swine okay and hope we'll see it and see basically if that works and we can go from there next week we need to get their gear 
C:	sure 
T:	okay Don it's been really good to talking with you today thank you  
C:	all right you have a good day I think that was a little bit better
