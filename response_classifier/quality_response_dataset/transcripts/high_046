T:	hi Quinn I'm glad that you came to see me today my name is me and I'll be your nurse what would you like to talk about
C:	of your current myself if it's really from Captain tanner I'm also worried about my house will get worse if I don't exercise more
T:	sounds like you're concerned about eating too many five foods and not exercising enough so which of these two concerns would you like to focus more on today
C:	our men testing within our society it's very important to control my blood sugar I'm finding it hard to attempt to exercise know since that I have to work five days a week and took it comes with my kitchen so I guess which the starter there
T:	okay well I appreciate you bringing it up it's true many people diabetes find it hard to add exercise to your life especially when their busy schedules it must seem overwhelming to have to fit exercise into your life when you have so many other priorities
C:	yes exactly
T:	so tell me what's living with diabetes been like for you
C:	we are it had done w day I hope to watch what are you or the fam make sure I don't care you have a pic of my accident a top of that everyone goes to me I need to exercise and I really don't like ecstasy
T:	you must be so stressful how to make so many changes to your life because of your diabetes adding exercise to your list of things to do isn't making your life any easier you mentioned that you don't like exercising so maybe we can look from your perspective what exactly you think that and the disadvantages of exercise our first of all what exactly don't you like about exercising
C:	it's so difficult to get started and to keep a movie I'm so tired after work I the rugged Esther real taxa and the CTL my culture and watched TV on the spend more time with my children
T:	you struggle with exercising because you're already tired after coming home from work and exercise increases your fatigue
C:	yes
T:	so tell me then what are the benefits of exercising to you
C:	I know then it becomes the to decrease to my blood pressure on me to lower my blood sugar that is not so tightly that's what the doctors decide
T:	you understand that exercising here and prove your overall health
C:	yes
T:	so where does that leave you now
C:	even though I know that our society of happily managing my sugar levels I just don't feel once are their facades
T:	so as long as you feel fine you don't see the need to exercise
C:	oh that's right
T:	what if you felt that your house was getting worse that you're starting to feel the symptoms of your diabetes even though the symptoms of type 2 diabetes develops slowly in the early stages and can go unnoticed for years if blood sugar is left uncontrolled it can lead to many complications would you like me to tell you more about that
C:	next room
T:	for example diabetes can lead to health problems like hypertension nerve damage or even kidney disease
C:	because sorts as a lot you take insulin if you have to control your blood sugar and I may enjoy fried food sometimes but most of time and prettily almost alcohol
T:	that's true insulin is a big part of glucose control and it's also great to hear that you're able to maintain a healthy diet despite your busy schedule that's quite an accomplishment exercise can also complement these effects actually exercise can help your bodies up your blood sugar and has been proven to be more effective or even or just as effective as medication
C:	what heck yes
T:	so it seems that being healthy is pretty important to you and that having symptoms of diabetes or feeling sick worries you
C:	because I want to be able to take home for my kids they are i still can I don't want to be sick and unable to see them grow up
T:	okay let me summarize what we just talked about you're not sure that you want to be here today the only reason you came is because your doctor felt that exercising more would help you manage your diabetes at the same time you haven't been feeling any symptoms of your diabetes so that's why I don't feel the need to exercise but if indicated that you want to prevent feeling sick and you like to be healthy for in order to take care of your children in fact you're ready doing so many things to help look after your health such as taking your insulin regularly eating a healthy diet and not consuming any alcohol did I miss anything
C:	no that's correct
T:	I see where you're coming from normally in order to control her blood sugar you have to live a healthy lifestyle you're ready doing a great job doing that by taking your insulin on time eating regular regularly and healthy diet and not consuming any alcohol so the only other thing you can do is exercise but you don't see the need to exercise and you find it hard to fit into your schedule
C:	sorry i don't like society but i do want to keep the interesting to look of mine are you saying lanta i can stay here say it even access long
T:	yes that's exactly what I'm saying
C:	I'll be like this I coulda tried to start seeing them
T:	all right if since you wanted to exercise would you mind if we took some time to find out how i feel about exercising
C:	okay
T:	on a scale of zero to ten in terms of how important you feel they need to exercise zero being not important and 10 being very important how important do you think exercises to you
C:	I'm 17
T:	seems that you think that exercising is pretty important then how come you're at a seven and not a two or three
C:	like Isis are that I don't want to this point of my kids I'm in too sick to care for me I will marry to do anything for them
T:	the thought of not being able to take care of your kids scares you you must love them very much
C:	yeah more than anything in the world
T:	now let me ask you how confident you are from the scale of zero to ten where zero is not confident at all and 10 is very confident in order to regularly exercise
C:	I remember I've had a hard time exercising you know Carston because I've been so Carrie I just took tore down on the treadmill for 30 minutes but it was hard to do that every day I think I meant for
T:	so you're moderately confident what would help increase your confidence
C:	I mean I guess if I had the more encouraging them to exercise and or the increase in my confidence also it would exercise so tearing that we're gonna have to
T:	in the past what is help you to continue exercising
C:	sometimes to my husband would encourage exercise but not the loss of him
T:	more support from your husband would help you to continue exercising maybe we can also explore additional options as to how to motivate you to exercise
C:	like what
T:	well you mentioned that you think exercising will take away from the time you want to spend with your children would you consider including your children in your exercise routine
C:	that's a risky idea i guess i put the puller you some games this then we really repre
T:	and you mentioned earlier that you used to run to exercise but running is a very high intensity exercise it would be hard for anybody to run for 30 minutes a day would you what exercises do you think would be easier for you to try
C:	maybe you're walking
T:	would you be willing to consider walking for 15 minutes after dinnertime
C:	that's what a walk
T:	that's a great start would you like to schedule an appointment next week to discuss more about your fried foods consumptions and other ways we can help you to keep exercising
C:	thank you
