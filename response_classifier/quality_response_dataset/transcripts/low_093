C:	I've heard it all but I just want to get my teeth fixed.
T:	Yes and I really want to be helpful. I really want you to know my commitment is to your oral health so umm there are lots of medications out there, David that actually take away alot of the cravings there they make things soo much easier.
C:	I did a pill thing so I did try it.I did try it. I did the pill thing and they didn't work.
T:	mmm
C:	It was a waste and it uh caused more side effects.
T:	No it but David. David it's not a waste. Research shows that people take on average about  tries before they quit smoking so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting.
C:	Or seven lectures along the road.
T:	Ah well I don't think I'm giving you a lecture.
C:	Well
T:	That's certainly not what I meant.I
C:	Naw I just feel that way.I get really, I get very defensive about when I get it from my family doc my cardiologist, everybody. Like I'm not a complete fool. I am for smoking.
T:	Well there there's a reason that.
C:	It's not easy to quit.
T:	people are concerned. No but as I said these medications So you've tried the medication you've been willing once
C:	Yep
T:	Then can I write you a prescription for the medication and can we talk about how you could use it because this is something that that it's very important. Not just for your overall physical health
C:	I guess I gotta really want to. Things I've tried, they usually cause me more problems than they helped.
T:	Oh no, the smoking will cause you more problems than the than anything else. I can promise you that.David, the side effects from the medications are nothing compared to what can happen from the smoking.
C:	mmm
T:	Like that's the thing to really consider.
C:	Okay well, can I go now?
C:	I know what, I know Doc what you're trying to, I I just don't want to get into that right now.
