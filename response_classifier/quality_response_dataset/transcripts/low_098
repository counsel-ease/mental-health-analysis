T:	Can I help you?
C:	Uh yea, I just got off work and apparently they're going smoke free so I thought I'd stop by the pharmacy here and see what my options are. Some of my friends have tried nicotine patches and they say they work very well. I don't really wanna quit smoking, I just need something to get me through the day.
T:	So you want nicotine replacement but you don't want to quit smoking?
C:	Maybe like, during the day nicotine replacement. Is that, I mean do you have anything like that?
T:	Yea, we don't really recommend that. The idea is that you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit so then you wouldn't be smoking at work but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either.
C:	Well I don't really want to quit, I mean I like smoking, I like going after work to have a beer with my friends, not smoke cigarettes. I mean, I know it's not really a big deal, cigarettes aren't that bad. I mean I know it's popular to say smoking is bad for you but ya know, I like it so I'm going to keep doing it.
T:	Okay well smoking really is really bad for you, you know it causes things like lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease.
C:	Yeah. Okay.
T:	Oral disease.
C:	Oh well what are my options now? Assuming that I am right, what are my options?
T:	Well to be honest with you, you mentioned the patch, I can't recommend a patch to you if you're going to continue smoking that can actually be pretty dangerous for you. In order to advise you about this at all I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now.
C:	I smoke barely a pack a day. I mean I probably smoked about  or  years now. It's not really a lot of cigarettes but it's sorta hard to get through the day at work.
T:	Okay well we actually consider  cigarettes a day to be a significant amount and in fact I would then recommend to you that you start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement.
C:	Sounds good to me. The more nicotine the better. Is there like gum or something? Could I chew it like while I'm in the office? That sounds pretty great. Do you have?
T:	Well there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings, then probably the gum would be the best option for you. It's not something that you would continue to use continuously throughout the day however but gum is something you use just when you have a craving.
C:	Oh. Okay. Well where is that?
T:	Well, we have that here but again but the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking.
C:	Well, I'm probably not going to buy anything today. I mean I just came by to see what my options are. Thanks for the input. Do you have anything else? Do you have any other?
T:	Well.
C:	Advice for me?
T:	Aside from the gum you could try the nicotine lozenge that would be another option for you, again that's not something you wanna use continuously throughout the day. The nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement but again that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke.
C:	Oh well. Okay, well, thanks, I mean I guess that helps a little bit. Maybe I'll be back later. Thanks.
