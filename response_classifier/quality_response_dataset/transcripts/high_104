Drink Fest in the morning no different than any financial difficulties that you're experiencing because of the all knowing.  
C:	I can afford it all right. 
T:	How do you see your of your alcohol use of this point in time.  
C:	Of I feel it is fairly more or.  The word of the fighting the getting brand of is that she doesn't like it you see the problem so.  You might have to look at that mission OK well.   
T:	Tell me tell me what you think of the other good things about drinking what does drinking do for you 
C:	helps me relax after work.  Hanging out of the boys.  Yeah I have a voice being pretty shy I as a person is a troll.  So I do need you know that confidence  T:	OK So correct me if I'm wrong it gives you confidence because you generally are a shy person it helps you relax after work yes but we've spoken about the good things if I have to ask you  what is the less good things about drinking what would that be.  
C:	Well this.  Is the drink driving charge.  The obviously the fighting Brenda.  Get pretty.  Scared of me sometimes.  The thoughts of the partner when I broke my hand had to take a couple weeks off work which was expensive you know.  Parents said that I'm looking less healthy.   
T:	You mentioned that parents of.  The talked about you looking at a little bit less healthy.  Do you have any medical problems at all or diabetes high blood pressure.  And can.  That ever have faints or seizures as a result of not having or call having alcohol.  
C:	No not that I have a ripple or like 
T:L	so just to summarize the less good things that you mentioned you talked about your relationship your family's really really concerned.  The drinking driving charge as the five as yet where you ended up hurting yourself quite seriously.  And then the other there's good things you can think of
C:	not felt great in the morning after a big one so the one where the hang over is you know.  
T:	 We've looked at the positives the drinking the negatives the drinking What foods do you have now.  More.  
C:	I guess a there are more negative.  And who are.  Specially Brenda in the fight in the ultimatums.  she may have a point.   T;	But what concerns you the most about about Currently if we look at your drinking what concerns you the most 
C:	losing Branda you know.   
T:	What what do you think.  Of the advantages of you actually stopping or cutting down the drinking buddy thing might be the advantages.  
C:	To.  Improve relationship.  Health health benefit is yeah.  I guess I'd be saving some money yeah yeah.  Yeah.  
T:	 I mean all those things that encourage you to make a change or yeah there would be made.  Do you feel that I mean what other any other things that would encourage you to actually make that change.  I don't think I'm getting around well the fact that you're here in the case that it is a part of you sort of wants to wants to maybe make a change or look at it seriously and would I be right in saying oh.  Yeah yeah OK.  Well what do you think might be the practical things that would help you make that change if you did decide to make that.  I'm not sure I'm over well that's something we can definitely talk about further you know we can always come up if you do decide to cut down drinking and look at it seriously then can talk about different strategies to do that.  Do you do you have any fears about making that change you know stopping drinking because I understand it is a big part of your life do you have any fears about stopping it.  
C:	Or the maybe hard to hang out with the boys.  And not have a drink.  That's about it.  So do you say it is a problem no drinking or great  
T:	I think there are a number of things that we need to consider Firstly the the amount you drinking which is approximately as you said you know looking at five drinks an average per day is definitely above the recommended guidelines for safe drinking.  In definitely no strain and also in the United Kingdom soup the normal recommended guidelines would be about two stand drinks per day so obviously as you're exceeding it it's definitely above the safe limits of drinking but in addition you've also got certain characteristics that fulfill a quite serious for what we would call alcohol dependence OK Now what that means is your alcohol use a sort of.  Escalated to a level where you where your body's gotten very very used to it so you're craving for a drink you find difficult stopping in one your bodies requiring more alcohol to get the same effect OK at the same time it's affecting several aspects of your life it's affecting your relationship.  You know social life in the sense that you know you've gotten into trouble with the police you've gotten into fights you know sometimes things can have disastrous consequences with the fight except for your family members a big concern and the concern that this is If things progress you know the amount that you will need will recall will because of the tolerance that alcohol can induce in the body because the body gets used to the amount of drinking that one more and more over time to get the same effect as a result of that it can have both psychological and physical consequences on the physical consequences can be it can affect your liver to a great extent it can affect your brain again just in if in the extent and also of course psychological consequences can cause depression anxiety so there are several things that we need to look at and that this level of drinking it definitely I would consider it problematic so it's something that we can look out.  And and talk about further.  OK but I appreciate that again I say that you've taken and it's a very very big step that you've taken to come in here in and talk to me to there.  And you do seem like you you want to make.  A difference to your relationship.  What I like to do is to give you some information to take on 
C:	OK OK
T:	 about alcohol in the harmful effects of alcohol and one's life one's health because it tends to affect several domains of one's life you know financial social occupational health of the psychological and physical health other family members.  Is all those to the several things that Uncle can affect the like you have a read of it and what we can do is we can have a meeting with yourself and Brenda next time and we can look at it for them does that seem reasonable a sense of oh well thanks for coming in today I'll give you some information take a little catch up in two weeks thank you.
