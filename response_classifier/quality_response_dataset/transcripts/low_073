T:	So we talked a lot about the way your medications are working or not working or not working I have some suggestions I think that we need to start with really clean up a lot of your medication so the opiates aren’t really working for you and I'm really concerned because the dose you are at. I suppose you are taking too much Tylenol.
C:	Tylenol?
T:	There are Tylenol in the Percocet and you can reach a limit that actually damage your liver so there's some concerns there. Also the opiates that you are taking are above what we call the watchful though so that can actually increase your risk of dying relating to take an opioid that much overtime. 
C:	ut that’s all prescribed by my doctor, I’m sure he would know that. I’m above this watchful dose, I’m taking too much Tylenol. It should be fine. What’s the issue with having too much Opioid, I take what I need.
T:	well he should know, but he’s new, so maybe he doesn’t know. Anyways he send you to us and we are really the experts in the area, so we can make all these recommendations and he can work with you to carry this out. So first of all we are gonna take down your dose of Oxycodone. Second of all, we need to relook at the medications you are on firstly. All these different medications interrupt with each other.
C:	What do you mean sleep medication? I’m here just for the pain assessment.
T:	So it’s just all this medication tie together. You don’t have to worry about anything, we are gonna be making recommendations to take care of everything. But to be honest, I can even believe that you are still awake while you are here. Like this is probably snowing you while you don’t realize. Did you drive here? 
C:	I took the TTC but like I made it on to the TCC and I’m talking to you and I’m clearly not snowed. My sleeping medication is what I need to sleep. This is the pain assessment you are doing? I just don’t know why you are touching my sleeping meds. Those are fine.
T:	It’s really hard to explain, it’s really complex. But trust me, we are going to make the recommendation, and you just need to follow it step by step. Everything should be fine.
