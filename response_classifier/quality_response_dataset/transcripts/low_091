T:	hi pharmacists I have some questions that I really need to speak to someone about 
T:	yeah pharmacist go ahead 
C:	so I'm going to let your advice because my son doctor is really on my case about getting vaccinated against the measles because of all the cases that are happening but I really don't believe in vaccines 
T:	well the measles is a really bad infection so it's really important you need to give your son the vaccinations 
C:	what about all the risks my son's never been sick because I make sure he  washes those hands I keep them away from public places and I give them walk the vitamins 
T:	it doesn't matter if your son's always healthy vitamins don't treat the measles
