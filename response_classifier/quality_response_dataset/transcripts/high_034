T:	Jeffrey tell me what you'd like to talk about today
C:	um that's all you can call me Jeff that's fine um I don't know there's just so much going on right now hey I lost my job two months ago and I don't know I was like taking care of myself so much better and it's just I stopped going to church as much and it's been really tough because my wife and my two kids aren't living with you right now so I'm just trying to get my just kind of get trying to get myself together right now and so I mean you're the first person I've seen in four days I just don't know I just don't know what to do
T:	okay so right now you have so much going on that you're just feeling totally overwhelmed you don't even know where to start
C:	yeah
T:	thinking about trying to control your diabetes just seems like one more
C:	yeah I did likely from like a bottom of a job like how can I think about you know checking my sugar and irregular basis I'm trying to just get out of bed you know I'm not sleep till 2:00 p.m. like I've been doing
T:	here you've been feeling a little bit depressed right now
C:	yeah yeah it's not hopeful
T:	so it sounds like you mentioned that you had been going to church some like the people that you had
C:	that's part of what I'm scared about is you know what if they aren't there like one thing that was really cool is on Wednesdays me and a few my friends have walked the Bible study instead of driving and it was fun one of the friends was named Cheryl and whenever I didn't go she'd call up and be like so you know she's always getting me to go and just I didn't want to let them down I also really enjoyed it so we just talked about work I have a job now but I mean we just I don't know we just talked about life you know
T:	yeah exactly yeah in two in two of them had diabetes as well so sometimes we were just Chad you know see you people were you know just taking care of themselves get into the clinic doing whatever they needed to do so
C:	yeah I just I just I don't know I just it's just it's just tough because you know not only do I miss my friends but I also miss being a good husband and being a dad and and being able to provide and just I mean I had to get food at the church food pantry you know two weeks ago and you know it shouldn't be like that I should be able to support them and to you know work hard go to or come home you know cook dinner help with the homework I mean I'm not doing any have no structure of our life right now you know I I mean I could sleep until 2 p.m. because who cares you know
T:	it sounds a little bit like you're feeling a change that you can't fill this role that you
C:	it's not so much ashamed it's just embarrassed you know it's like I I I mean even just saying this I'm kind of like hope you know that you don't judge me or whatever because I did I can't even it's hard to even just say this I don't want things to be like this you know it's hard enough sometimes having diabetes and being embarrassed around that but throw all this other stuff on and it's too much I just don't even want to acknowledge it really you know
T:	you're really frustrated because there's so many things going on in your life that you feel like you don't even have control
C:	exactly exactly yeah I mean at least I had control as far as going to work going to church taking care of my family I mean those are three things that helped having those in balance I could focus on my diabetes because it was as part of my routine and I got ready for work you know like that was just part of my routine
T:	so in the past when you were able to have the structure and also the support of people around you it's sort of added more daily basis there's a lot easier
C:	yeah it wasn't easy but it along or I just felt like I could deal with it
T:	okay so you know you're really overwhelmed right now and everything just sort of really it sounds like you may have identified a few things to think about in trying to figure out where to move forward I did work in the past
C:	right now some things work you're right
T:	so having some social support having some structure
C:	yeah
T:	those might be some areas to to think about
C:	yeah
