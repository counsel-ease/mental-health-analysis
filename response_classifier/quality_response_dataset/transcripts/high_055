T:	you in summary the minnesota state mankato security report states that you were stopped on Stadium Road last Friday cited for driving under the influence and then you are transported to detox plus you're only 21 years old is the report accurate
C:	I guess so I don't really remember much like those a week ago so I was kind of drawn to
T:	ok behavior like this could get you suspended doesn't that concern you
C:	mm-hmm I mean not really I'm gonna be 21 in a couple months I'm potentially alone the cops came to me a minor I mean I'm not a heavy drinker like like my friends or anything I don't get wasted at all and I just hey be careful I just won't get caught I'm just trying to find like a normal college student
T:	what were you thinking when you got into your car after having six beers you could have caused an accident and killed somebody
C:	whatever I didn't know I called my roommates for a ride you sleepy so idea home somehow and this is name of my fault I can ride all the time but I didn't do anything
T:	you need to take responsibility for your actions do you keep partying like this your problems will only get worse you're likely to face costly legal citations for grades health problems getting kicked out of school and disappointing your parents you don't want that to happen do you
C:	no no like I said this is my fault like are we done here have class in 15 minutes
T:	your behavior is now a Minnesota State University expects of its students if you want to be a student here you'll need to show that you're able to follow our rules do you think you can do that otherwise you'll be suspended
C:	look I really like corn I miss you and I gilja sand you you're making some really good points and i'll think about them okay
T:	okay well your sanction is you'll be placed on university disciplinary probation and you'll have to attend an alcohol education seminar that will cost you one hundred and fifty dollars also disciplinary action is progressive and cumulative meaning that any further violations will result in suspension for one semester or longer
C:	$150 are you serious I can't pay that all right I'm done with those I'm good
T:	in summary the minnesota state mankato security report states that you are stopped on Stadium Road last Friday excited for driving under the influence and you're transported to detox plus the report lists your ages twenty Dillon what is the accuracy of the report and can you share with me some details leading up to the incident
C:	I guess that sounds that sounds right I mean I was kind of drunk and it happened like a week ago I just I drove over to my friends house just to go watch the game and you know we're having a couple beers and X and O the Vikings accountabilities in pretty big so we drank a little bit more than usual and I mean at the end I had to get home and I couldn't find a ride so I just rolled
T:	you decided to drink more than you intended because you were disappointed at how the Vikings were playing and when your roommate couldn't give you a ride home you decided to drive yourself home did I get that right
C:	yeah that's exactly how it happened I mean I'm a normal college kid I had to drink in a house and buddies I mean it wasn't a big house party or anything that got busted
T:	yeah I understand that your intention would have a good time while watching the game with your friends you didn't think about what could go wrong when you drink alcohol underage because you were at your friend's house not a big party and you made an effort to be safe by finding a ride home
C:	and I tried to be safe I mean I tried to call her roommate but I am getting in trouble anyways
T:	dawn you told me what brought you here today what do you think the problem really is
C:	um let's say I have a drinking problem I think I probably have more of a like getting caught problem I mean my friends they drink like fishes and I they don't ever get cotton and you got me over here and I get caught and left
T:	sounds like you attribute your current situation a bad luck if that's what you believe and you don't attempt to make any change in your behavior what consequences might result
C:	I guess I got some more problems with police in school and I really don't have like the time or the money for any of that
T:	how important is it that you avoid future problems with the police or school villain
C:	it's just super important because just just going to detox alone was was awful the experience I don't want to do that again and my dad said if I get suspended from school I'll have to have to go work on my uncle's farm in Iowa and that would just kill my social I don't see any of my friends and I mean it's already bad enough like my parents took my car away when I got the DUI
T:	yeah what would you be willing to do to prevent going to detox again and getting suspended
C:	well yes I I guess the easy one is I want to drink so much and I try to avoid situations where I'm more likely to get in trouble so probably I don't want to drink so much
T:	on a scale of one to ten how confident are you that you'll be able to follow through with that plan with ten being very confident
C:	I guess I would say like I don't like over halfway is so maybe like a sex
T:	what steps could you take to move that six or seven or eight
C:	I could probably I guess well it's the big thing would be like kind of where I drink so like drinking like if I'm only like in my apartment so then I'm not risking myself to drive very like if I go out to a party waiting to like I'm 21 to drink maybe find stuff to do that doesn't revolve around drinking like I'm guessing like a town this size there's got to be more to do the just drink
T:	in what ways might your life be better if you succeed in making the changes you mentioned
C:	um I mean I guess the big one would be like I went I won't be hungover all the time like I would make it to my 8 a.m. then well even even when I make it to my ATM's now like I just I sleep like I wake up I'm like oh my god what's going on and then I get to my 8 a.m. and I'll just sleep through and then I'm this just about everything that's on the test so I think if I if I reprioritize what is important to me it probably helped me succeed I mean in high school I had a 3.5 GPA is I know I could do it here
T:	College is all about making choices can you tell me about your beliefs and values that influenced your decision making and how do those beliefs and values align with the decisions you plan to make about drinking
C:	um I mean education is really important to me and and also my family talking about it and I really I really want to be an international journalist to be on the news like I mean I have the face for it so I guess if I reprioritize mind if I read prioritize what I need to do like and I won't drink so much I probably want to be disappointing my parents and I'd be able to get a really good education
T:	thanks for coming in for participating today your sanction will involve being placed on university disciplinary probation and attending an alcohol education seminar that will cost $150 RS
C:	Oh what is the seminar
