T:	What  can i do to help?
C:	yeah well the only reason I'm here is because my wife thinks I got a problem with smoking I've been smoking all my life and six months ago she thought she got in this health kick right and now everyone who smokes is evil and so that's why I'm here just to please her get her off my back 
T:	and so you're not too happy to be here this is the last thing that you want to be doing this afternoon 
C:	yeah that's an understatement I mean I'm supposed to be at work right now - 
T:	all right so I can time off you it's costing you time and money 
C:	yeah I'm only here because my wife forced me to come you know like this has come to a head six months so just nagging me relentless every day because she was able to quit smoking and now I have to quit 
T:	so let me ask you this Bob what are some of your wife's concerns about your smoking?
C:	well she's concerned about my health and she cuts out all these articles from the paper about secondhand smoke and 
T:	Wow that she's been showing you and making you read 
C:	yeah I got to read this that's my reading assignment for breakfast and I want to go and have we used to go and have a cigarette together at the table now I have to go outside in this weather you know what's that about and she's to smoke more than me and now she's like holier than thou
T:	so you're pretty angry about it it's pretty aging that you're forced to change your whole life 
C:	because of a decision she made six months and she's got my kids on this against you know my son and my daughter there I would it's like they're ganging up on me you know what I mean 
T:	so from your perspective do you see any consequences to your smoking
C:	well the big one of course is how it's affecting my wife and I in the family but like my dad's  he still smokes I mean yeah you know sometimes I thought of quitting but I mean I don't I don't know if I can guy I don't I can quit 
T:	so let me make sure I understand kind of the whole scenario because there's a lot of pieces to it your wife is on your case and your kids are ganging up too so you're sort of isolated you're put in a corner you're being told this is something you have to do you have no choice in the matter well you have a few concerns about your health but that's not really the driving force it sounds like it's most of all that it would be nice if things just went back to the way they were before she quit smoking and that all of this stuff wasn't something that you had to deal with anymore does that pretty much sum up?
C:	yeah yeah I just I don't want to lose her or my family over smoking I get the feeling that your relationship is really important to you that you would do anything well yeah I mean we've been married over  years and we've never had any major problems like this is a writ this is the first problem I don't even really see it's a problem because we used to both smoke and I was trying to accommodate them by smoking outside and but it's feeling like we're going like this and I'm just concerned like if this keeps going on like so it strikes me that the way that we're talking about it 
T:	it's like it's all or nothing either you keep smoking the way you are things continue to go downhill and get worse your wife gets more and more on your case or you put your cigarettes down starting the moment you walk in the door tonight and never pick them up again it's almost like one or the other it's tries to be that as well there might be some middle ground here that it took you a long time to learn how to be a smoker and maybe it's going to take some time to learn how to stop smoking so I can actually do it that way like gradual taper there are some medications and some different approaches that we can use that aren't so abrupt recognizing that it's going to take some time and practice to get to where you might want to be
C:	I wish my wife could have come today because she feels I have to like just stop Rick right away so do you think she could come with me at a future appointment or something and she could hear that message 
T:	if you wanted to bring your wife along I'd be more than happy to talk both of you okay I hope the doctors work because their schedule changes from week to week so you work shift so I'll call you back tomorrow set something up
C:	okay that sounds good all right thanks for coming in thanks okay
