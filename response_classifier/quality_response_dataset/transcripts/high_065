C:	yes
T:	yes
C:	yes so walgreens whopping two-year like what you decide
T:	well I've been struggling with some anxiety issues lately and I can't seem to figure out why I just I've been having some like anxiety attacks and panic attacks just wasn't like the last couple months and I thought him just go away on their own and like they think has come on at night sometimes or at first I thought they were centered around like papers and normal collops things but then like I had one were fall break whenever I didn't have anything to do looking to be here
C:	have you so you see that it has nothing to do with schoolwork because you said you have a really cool place and you don't think I hadn't anything to do it back
T:	I don't think into this and I mean it's a big school of constant thing so it's my senior year or two and I had to pop up until now so I I don't know I can't really figure out what could be causing it
C:	how are things at home with your family
T:	I'm dinner going well my little sister actually she's a freshman in college this year so my parents are at home with the emptiness and trying to figure out what i'm going to do with their free time and call me a lot i went off a lot but I mean everything's fine I see my grandparents pretty often my sister is going well
C:	that's good so so you and your family are going well
T:	we're we ever pretty close
C:	how I was like the social life like how are things at school you know with your friends and ball how are things going
T:	socially everything is going well too just trying to keep everything balanced it's a but I mean I feel like I'm doing a pretty good job of it
C:	you get very clean school and stuff
T:	yeah and i will say that senior year brings you know the senioritis around sometime so it's hard to get some motivation in there but um I mean schools would well like I I'm happy with my grades are socially I'd say that I mean my friends are still there like I love my friends I'm i feel like i do the same things that is nothing different going on
C:	okay
T:	socially I
C:	just just get anxiety attacks just randomly
T:	yeah
C:	do you notice any pattern maybe when things id attack occurs
T:	so I had probably five or six within the past month a couple of them happen at night only who actually most only the only one happy birthday but I wasn't like around anybody see any patterns with that at a loss
C:	but he had any strange or reoccurring dreams
T:	um actually I have they're just been like weird dreams that it's like I don't know it kind of plays on the future a lot but then like whenever i wake up i can't remember like specific details from it like you have you had a dream where you it feels so really you wake up and you Cameron really what just happened
C:	yeah that's usually how you know it works a lot of people put a note pad next to their their bed and the second they wake up they write down what they dreamt about so they don't forget and like it's just something that people do but maybe that's something that you can try oh my good yeah so you say your sister her brother
T:	sister
C:	just left home why she going to school
T:	she is in school at Spelman in Atlanta so she is having fun hopefully studying oh no she's not playing sports she just ran their students

T:	yeah I was I don't know cuz every time I talk to her she's like like they have a lot of going on down there Nixon is it Lana like it's my Burlington North Carolina so I talked to her I'm like when you ever study I don't really you know every time I talk to your do it comes you too jealous but we should
C:	yeah okay so when you have anxiety like wouldn't have these attacks like what are you feeling
T:	I feel like scared I feel almost like a pressure like I can't breathe you type of thing but more like a scared feeling
C:	do you feel helpless
T:	yeah
C:	yeah what do you thought
T:	well the first time it happened like I never had before so I didn't know what's going on and I was like in my room just about a little bit not doing anything in particular so the first time it really scared me and then you know it took me a few seconds just like started reading my guardian graduate and then a house wine so I think the more they happened I hope they will just call myself down and just keep going few minutes later and not think about it but I don't want them to keep all right well
C:	that's good that you're about to keep my calm yourself down and that's good have you talked to any of your friends about it
