T:	can you talk about the transformation that you see in people
C:	it's it keeps me coming back to work every day you know I get to see them walk in and I get to see that transformation slowly and it's beautiful you know you don't you can't beat that
T:	I mean realistically not everyone is a success story and we see its relapse it's a part of recovery but but for most cases though that difficult cases that do a good job and make that transformation when does that usually occur
C:	I think it's different for everyone I mean and we really can't tell who's going to make it by who has a better you know a bigger desire it's a journey and it's this process and so sometimes it happens where you see that light come on sometimes they're struggling and they're discharging and that's that's probably the most difficult part of the job is knowing that someone's not ready to be brought back to their environment and yet that's what has to happen you know it's a transitional period so
T:	so they finished the first month of treatment and then it's time to go back to their life because they have to work or they have school or they have kids at home that's what you're talking about that's what's what's difficult or scary for you when they have to leave
C:	yeah because it's you know this is a family disease so when you know you leave that environment that was totally chaotic when you leave like the partner and the kids and the bills and the job and the everything and you remove yourself from that environment may you get popped back into it it's like the people around you assume that great you're finally home because now you can take care of the kids and pick up the you know dry cleaning and you know it's they expect you to be there the way you were and so much more and it's completely unrealistic and you know that they're not willing to change their behaviors if they're still going to be able to drink or have pills or whatever it is and it's it's not okay it's not safe and so that it's a difficult thing
T:	is there a strategy that you use that that that you have found to be successful in your experience with maybe that the problem cases are the harder cases
C:	I think that's a common like idea is that oh the ones that have been through treatment a bunch are more difficult or those who have you know just been unsuccessful and they've tried or they've grown up in this environment or that environment and you know it's everyone is different that's why I I personally have a very eclectic approach to each individual and I work with a fantastic team that I can run things by you know people who have stronger knowledge base on certain things so I think everyone has to be approached individually
T:	so I guess the message here is that the transition is really important yes the treatment facility is good you could need to go to the detoxification the group therapy but it's also that transition period in every facility I think has a an intensive outpatient program or a sober living environment or at least the referrals that you can get to that so it doesn't just stop after the 28 days it continues and that's I think what we're saying professionally here well actually leads us to the last our last show we we met with the girl named sunny and we're gonna do a flashback here but sunny was basically offered treatment and she she's knows so much about herself she's very good at saying exactly what she feels and she you could just see there was no hope there she basically said look I've been through these programs I helped run these programs I was a counselor and I was going into the bathroom and I was shooting up in the bathroom and I was going out and no one even knew it for weeks and weeks and weeks and so then at this point she's like well I'll try it but why bother at this point I'd been through it all I know myself and we've all been there where we knew ourselves we knew that nothing was going to stand the way of our using we wanted to stop but our head just check something happened in our brains and something happened with with our lives that all of a sudden we would go back to using again and she knew herself but is it always is anyone a lost cause that's it always worth it
C:	absolutely
C:	my wife Sonny had a period of sobriety and she relapse back in May we have a small child we have two and a half year old son
T:	there's always another chance no matter how bad it gets is it possible can we talk to your
C:	15 years and I put my step worth on the back burner and I went out I was shooting dope i was shooting heroin a meth in my neck every day and you know working and treatment trying to work there still you know and it's trying to go to this meeting and be secretary still high you know I said I wouldn't get high at work and you know that I'm trying to find a vein in the bathroom all night I had no mental defense against the needle I stole medication I went to sober living after so we're living I used there and i use there and i use there and i go on until i start doing things that are shady since i realized i've been able to put together more than a week
T:	is there a willingness or you are you basically giving up
C:	what's what's gonna do this time you know why is this place gonna be magical
T:	so what I'm asking you at this point will you give it one more shot and are you willing to go to treatment
C:	another
T:	at this point what do we have to lose you know what's scary
C:	I get the all right
T:	thank you so much for doing this i know that it hasn't been easy
C:	no problem
T:	how are you doing first of all
C:	i'm doing excellent i feel great
T:	there was one part where we actually asked her it was cut out we said you know do you want to go to treatment she says
C:	can I bring my cell phone like I don't know about that but you know I I you went to Spencer Recovery Center and I worked there so I'm able to see the transition as well I don't work in and him with you but Carrie does
T:	you know you you were honest about being a manipulator you were honest about the other programs you went to what's it like now for you what was it like what was different about this place
C:	you know I'm not really sure but there is something different I mean I don't know if it's with me or just with my like a psychic kind of change you know going in there except not being out of maybe desperation but just out of my own choice just to be like all right I'm gonna do something different with my life this time and really try and then I had a hard time for a little bit and I really worked with Carrie like to address some of my other issues that might be going on you know other than if I'm relapsing that much maybe there's something else going on with me besides just my addiction you know
T:	but you've worked hard it hasn't been easy
C:	no it hasn't I've had some struggles like just mental struggles you know when you get back into mode to a relapse it's like or feel that feeling and then you know if to just pray on it and just like so something else can intervene and like besides yourself you know because i did and God stepped in and took those things away you know like because once you're in that mode it's very hard to once you're locked in a mode that you decided to use or like that you're getting feeling like you may want to it's very hard to get yourself out of that and I managed to pull myself out of that with the help of Spencer
T:	the transition that we see just on the outside as well I mean people at home need to see that because when you're working for a facility at one point shooting drugs into your neck and then your back at home wondering how am I everyone do this because every Center that I went to i manipulated it and I ended up pulling one over on them and Here I am again back at home shooting drugs or using suboxone or whatever it is that you were doing I like to just take a few minutes to have your your dad and you have a little boy come up and talk to them just for a fitting
