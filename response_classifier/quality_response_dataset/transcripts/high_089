T:	hey hey doing today 
C:	I guess I'm okay how are you 
T:	I'm well thanks for asking  soyou say you're doing okay what's going on 
C:	um just definitely no better than last week when we talked I mean it's been I had some major binges this week I don't even honestly know why we're bothering to talk about it because I've been down this road before mm-hmm I should just I should just like give up and buy some muumuus and you know just resigned myself to the fact that i'm going to get that and i'm going to stay at 
T:	tell me about some of the foods that you've been eating have been leading to this problem 
C:	brownies mm-hmm brownies brownies brownies and well that's what got it started you know I was great the first half of the week and I'm staying away from the sugar away from the flower my son has stayed home from school hurt his head you wanted to bake brownies my son okay let's bake brownies so then we ate the whole pan and we make two more pans and then it didn't just stay the brownies you know went out hamburgers french fries candy you know stopped in wawa the web host its disgusting I can't I don't want to tell you how much because it's just disgusting and clothes aren't fitting it's just really really sad 
T:	you've had a rough week 
C:	yeah 
T:	so let's talk about for a second I'd like to the kind of your relationship to this problem how do you view this problem 
C:	it's disgusting it's like a slave food owns me so the 
T:	so the food is in control of the situation 
C:	sounds ridiculous when you say it like that but that's what it is 
T:	it's in control all right so Nate I won't ask you a couple questions about that the importance and the confidence of changing clearly you have some desire to change or you wouldn't be here 
C:	oh my god I would love ya 
T:	so if you are looking at a scale of one to ten one was it's not important to change and ten was it's extremely important change this is just how important it is for you to curtail your eating  * very important to you yeah it's very important okay so what if I asked the same question except this time you're confident so one is you're not confident all you can change but  you're very confident could change
C:	I could probably change for half a day mm-hmm I've done it and sometimes if I'm lucky I'll get a week but overall overall it's impossible like you want a number at zero 
T:	so it's below the blow the scale of one to ten this is yeah so you end of no confidence at all 
C:	I've tried it I know I mean it's like beating my head against a wall see you 
T:	so on one hand you'd like to you'd like to stop to eating it's important to you the other hand you don't believe you can do it I
C:	can't you can't do it I can't it can't be done
T:	have there been any other changes you have been able to make say in the last few years that have been positive
C:	ah stop biting my nails
T:	so you had some small successes in terms of making changes what do you think makes the this I'll just refer to as the food problem so much more powerful so much more difficult to tackle
C:	I wish I knew there's so many things it's it's everywhere the food is a root is everywhere
T:	he mentioned before that brownies were the culprit for this last week 
C:	brownies hershey bars Hershey kisses yeah chocolate 
T:	you enjoy chocolate  yeah 
T:	okay how about other foods it could be contributing the problem that maybe you don't enjoy as much that's chocolate 
C:	Oh potato chips french fries Mexican food what else cheese definitely 
T:	any of the types of candies
C:	start name and I'm skittles cherry starburst basically any candy 
T:	pretty much any candy yeah so of of the candy so I want to focus just on the candies and not there the food is just for now the thought of like I introduced the idea is stopping eating chocolate how it's react to that not gonna happen 
C:	that's not gonna happen  I would love to write to happen right but that's not I can just tell you I don't even want to pretend so you know that for certain 
T:	how about the let's let's go for example with the skills what if I've introduced the idea of stopping the consumption of skills
C:	just candy skittles just just that one candy yeah why bother but like I not eat skittles is that what you're saying like 
T:	oh you could it's up to you whether you or not but if i enter just that idea of stopping the consumption of skittles how would you react to that  C	I don't really understand why 
T:	well it represents a change in the direction that you want to move 
C:	but if I stop eating skittles I'm still going to eat brownies I'm still going to eat 
T:	but we know we know that's an area that did you know you can't really make a change right now what you're saying like us the idea of stopping chocolate is not going over well with you know it's not gonna happen and that's fine but the idea of stopping skittles that's fine that doesn't seem as daunting no
T:	would you agree skittles on save the  scale that it's important to stop skills
C:	yeah okay yeah
T:	how confident are you you could not even 
C:	it's kind of funny now you're talking about it I've sort of want skittles more but you know I'd like from now until next week when I come in here hmm i'd say like i'm ninety-nine percent confident i could not eat skittles and it would not be a major problem 
T:	alright so this is a change that you think you could accomplish even though you're not sure it'll actually contribute to solving a larger problem
C:	we know that that's something that that's an area where you don't really see a changes as likely wiska 
C:	if I don't eat skittles this week or even for the rest of my life is it gonna solve my problem no but will I do it if that's what you want me to do yeah that's fine
T:	well I would hope it's something that that you would want to do I mean what I want is one thing what you wants really important here is this something that made our skills part of the problem yeah small yeah right no pun intended right in another small but it's a small part problem but your degree still part about
C:	yeah sure so 
T:	not a huge change but it's one that we can work on all right I want you to build to you know genuinely buy into the goal I mean if you don't think it's important we can talk about other areas change 
C:	no I guess I see what you're saying I mean if I'm going to be completely honest with you I well that's when I paying you for right so I don't think it's gonna work I'll just tell you that what 
T:	you think you could stop eating skittles but you don't think it's going to solve the larger problem or lead to exactly all right but that's what we have to work with right now because the larger problem is not something you mean the way you put it is it has control yeah yeah so if I are just the idea of stopping brownies no no no sorry isn't that so let's let's go after the change that we can achieve in this case it's not perfect it's not ideal but it's what you can do fair enough sounds like a plan so so for this week i'll see you again week for this week just just continue eating skills it was skittles all right let's go ahead and let's see let's see how we do with that change does that seem to make sense yeah all right so work with that and I'll see you can we thank you thank you
