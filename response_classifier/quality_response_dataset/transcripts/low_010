T:	good well would you mind taking a seat I have a couple things I want to go over with you about this medication
C:	okay sure should have some time
T:	okay well this should only take a few minutes so before we get started I just want to make sure I still got all the correct information so you're still on Emma Street with the same phone number and everything right
C:	yep
T:	okay so nothing's changed wonderful um now I was taking a look at your medication profile earlier and it looks like you're on two different strengths of lipitor so that obviously can't be right
C:	yeah I don't think no I don't think that's what I do
T:	okay so do you remember which one you're taking
C:	I don't know
T:	you don't know okay I think you're taking the 10 milligram tablets it's not right
C:	that sounds right and I remember the doctor was telling me that now that's that's what I'm doing now I'm pretty sure
T:	okay okay so the doctor gave you this new prescription but there's new medication is that right
C:	I think so
T:	okay okay so this medication is for your cholesterol
C:	okay
T:	and you're going to take it once a day it's really important that you take it every day all right and you can take it with her without food it doesn't really matters yes once a day
C:	okay okay
T:	okay and now the doctor did tell you this was your cholesterol right C yeah he said that's why I checked my blood last time that's why I was in for a visit right
T:	right exactly so that's why he wrote you this prescription so it's greater cholesterol you're just gonna take it once a day it's really easy C okay
T:	there are some side effects that go along with this medication but I wouldn't really worry about it because I mean you're young you're healthy it's not an issue so don't concern yourself with it okay all right so just to make sure that I didn't miss anything I'm just gonna repeat everything again to make sure you got it first time
C:	okay
T:	all right so this medication is for your cholesterol you're gonna take it once a day you can take it with a lot of water and you want to make sure you don't miss any doses okay
C:	okay
