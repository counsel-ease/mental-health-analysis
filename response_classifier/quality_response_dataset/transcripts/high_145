T:	hello Maria it's nice to see you 
C:	hello there was a good say it's nice to see you but it's never good to go to the doctor 
T:	mmm unfortunately for me I hear that a lot so we're going to be talking about ways to manage your blood clots and options for treatment but first I'd like to check in on a few things the first is your smoking you were at a half pack at during your last visit and we talked about how important it is for you to quit I'd say it's even more important now that smoking is associated with Davey T so have you quit 
C:	no I haven't quit 
T:	so do you remember our conversation from our last visit that's when I give you the information about quitting smoking and the contact number for tobacco treatment specialist 
C:	yes I remember but no I didn't quit and no I didn't call her 
T:	and why is that 
C:	I'm not ready and I'm too upset to talk about this I don't mean to be rude doctor but I've had a hard time lately and I'm not in the mood for you to get mad at me for not quitting I'll let you know when I'm ready and we can talk about it but here now today I'm here to talk about my blood clots 
T:	well we're on the same page then because that's exactly why I'm talking to you about quitting smoking because smoking is a major risk factor for DVT even if you even if we treat you now if you don't quit smoking I'm afraid the blood clots will return again
C:	let's just talk about my treatment right now 
T:	hello Maria it's nice to see you again
C:	hello I wish I could say it's nice to see you but it's never good to have to come to the doctor 
T:	unfortunately for me I hear that a lot so we're going to talk today about how to manage your blood clots and some options for treating but first I wanted to check in on your smoking status in our last visit I recommended that you begin to think about quitting and I would be interested in hearing your thoughts 
C:	well I haven't really thought about it actually I thought about canceling this appointment because I knew you were going to bring it up again talking about smoking with me as hard for you yes it's because you're going to tell me to quit like you always do and then it feels you're just like everyone else like my caseworker the building manager everybody seems to think they know what I need to do and nobody thinks I know anything 
T:	so when it comes to smoking you feel that other people want to tell you what to do and make your decisions for you you you don't feel heard or respected no respect that's it 
C:	yes 
T:	well I just want to say that I am very glad you decided to come in today so we can take care of this blood clot because blood clots are very serious and I know you're concerned as your provider I have to be honest and say that smoking can cause blood clots but hopefully some of the information I give you today will help you in your decision to quit smoking
C:	yeah 
T:	having said that I know my opinion is not the deciding factor quitting smoking as a decision only you can make 
C:	well I'm really glad I came into I have to get this blood clot condition under control
T:	I know that would it be okay with you if I share some information about smoking and blood clots and I can tell you what I know and then we'll see what you think
C:	yes I don't know that I will quit but I will listen   
T:	so what do you think
C:	I always thought that the blood clots came from my mother hello like passed down like genetics I didn't know that smoking could cause this I just thought that blood clots run in my family I guess I also didn't get how dangerous this clotting 
T:	can be you seem surprised and a little more aware now the smoking risks I guess so yes so Maria I'd like to get a better sense of what you think about smoking so on a scale of one to ten with one being you don't think it is at all important that you quit and ten being you're ready to quit today where would you put yourself 
C:	well if you had asked me when I first came in i would have said less than one 
T:	but now i would have to say for why a four and not a lower number 
C:	that's a good question let me think about it um I guess it's a four because of the blood clots the blood clots are really heavy on my mind right now 
T:	so having a better understanding of how smoking adds to the risk of blood clots increases your desire to quit or little 
C:	yes
T:	what else if anything makes quitting important to you 
C:	you know the bigger thing for me is the fear of being evicted from my apartment there's a rule that we can't smoke in the house and I stick to it for the most part but the other day I smoked out the window and that was only the second time I've done it but don't you know the building manager caught me so now i am sure she's going to be watching me even more I can't lose my apartment 
T:	the possibility of losing your apartment because of smoking really upsets you in addition to your health 
C:	I would hate to think that my son t and they lost their home because their mom chose smoking over a biting by a stupid code even if I hate that rule I smoked when I was pregnant with them and thank you Holy Mother they were born healthy I don't think I could live with myself if they lost their home because of something I'm doing 
T:	so it sounds like your priority in life is taking care of providing for your children it's obvious that you're a good mom and if you had to leave your home because you were smoking that would be tough to bear 
T:	so let me ask you a slightly different question on that same scale of one to  how would you rate your confidence to quit 
C:	Oh confidence oh I'd have to stay at two so you are not feeling very confident right now hello no not confident at all I mean I've tried to quit so many times and I just can't do it
T:	so you've been persistent in trying and haven't been successful yet still you you said a two and not a one I'm curious about that 
C:	well the only reason I said her too is that I tried quitting smoking when I was pregnant with santhi and they or both I went for two months without a cigarette with Dale and I didn't make it past that and that was really mad at myself for that I really wanted to quit from my babies and I failed I guess I'm just hopeless I mean who keeps smoking when there's a baby inside 
T:	it sounds like you really feel like you let yourself and your children down and that's hard to accept given how much you love your kids 
C:	yes and I'm doing it again right now by not following the rules I'm addicted to cigarettes just like a drug addict in the end the cigarettes always win 
T:	so what what do you think sante and thao think about your smoking 
C:	mmm Southee yells at me and sometimes they'll cries when I go out to smoke he says mama smoking is bad 
T:	so you know it would be best for you and your children if you quit if you had the right support and tools to manage this addiction if you believed you could do it you would 
C:	I'd like to think so but I just don't think I can do it 
T:	you quit for two months when you were pregnant with Te'o how did you do it then 
C:	I don't know and I just did it I fought the urges with sucking on straws and some hard candies said I just did it
T:	wow so you were able to quit on your own for two months that's impressive have you ever used any other form of help like nicotine replacement or support groups 
C:	mmm no I think people can quit if they really want to I'm just too weak 
T:	ah wow you must be pretty hard on yourself what would you say if I told you that very few people only four percent of us are able to quit successfully cold turkey no really is that true hmm yes and and most people try many times before their successful their medications and groups yet and I'd be happy to share that information with you I'd like to help you if that's something that you'd like
C:	well I don't know I'm let me think about it can you give me the information again the booklets that brochure you gave me before I didn't want to tell you but I threw them away when I got home but i really want to read them this time 
T:	that's great maria you can look them over and i'll have our tobacco treatment specialist sonya follow up with you we have an excellent tobacco treatment program here and I am I believe that Sonya can help you quit when you're ready okay what one would be a good time to check back in she can call me next week and I'll let you know I may be ready to try again absolutely and I'll have Sonya call you I just want you to know that I understand how hard it is for you to talk about quitting smoking and I really appreciate it so would you like to talk about how to manage a blood clots 
C:	yes that sounds
