T:	so what brings you in today lalamon 
C:	my son's behavior is just what you won't listen to any others he goes out whenever he wants to go out and his father and I are just fed up with it and his father's already said it since he turns  people call along so they're coming getting distorted putting in jail
T:	in frustrating because you have no control of the house 
C:	well yeah  T 	dislike these it was kids running the whole house 
C:	yeah we don't like he doesn't want everything 
T:	so you wish you had that pants and power where you can be able to get your son to do the things that you and your husband would like for him to do 
C:	well yeah I wish I had that power but he's not all this things to do to us he's already decided that he said said he said I was then they all do whatever I wanted so what's the point what's the point of even trying 
T:	sounds like you've given up on yourself to be able to use those parenting things to try to get him to be able to listen to your house he's gotten physical 
C:	yeah would especially with my husband swing at it first came in it can be kind of scary to live in a house with a adolescent male getting physical when he's upset yeah it is scared because I don't know how he's gonna react and you might be just fine today and tomorrow just for no reason he's exploded and a lot of weather can hit me take off what did he just tell me home so yeah I don't know what to do 
T:	and you tell me something well one thing I am here is that you guys are working really hard to try to get your family back on track and get your son back to the place where you guys can have that a better family family environment 
C:	well all the things we try they don't work tries it didn't work and he tells me something I try that work 
T:	one good thing is you're willing to trust them to something you really try some new things because you're open to that you've tried and you kind of said you gave up a little bit but what you just said that I heard was that you are willing to maybe pick up and try some new things that might be helpful 
C:	well if there's anything because I think we tried at all so feeling kind of doubtful that there's anything else I don't think about nothing else is work so why would people go ahead and tell me the best that that works to begin with
T:	well the good thing is we know  things that don't work so we don't have to do those things over again okay so if you had to rate it on a scale of one to ten how how important is it for you to try to strengthen your parenting skills with your husband?
C:	I guess one being I'm not doing anything else I've done everything else I can do and  me know we really you to try they really need to check well it used to be more for now it's probably about five or my husband is probably 
T:	about you want right something's going through this for a really long time and just feeling like you're the point where you want to be loved but you did say a five and you know that does leave room for hope so why wouldn't you say a two or one like your husband?
C:	cuz I because he's my son and I haven't given up and I care about him and and I think I know he can do better I just don't know how
T:	so you are very hopeful for your family and for your son just would you be willing to continue to work with me to to learn some of those things maybe I can be helpful for you to try to find some things that might fit for your family 
C:	well I willing to try mm-hmm 
T:	we got to get him in here and see if we can get you to on the same page but at least you're willing to say that you're willing to try 
C:	yeah I have good luck with the elbow 
T:	wow so you would be willing to come back in here next week and be able to sit with me and they kind of go from there new ways to work with your family and not try those always over again 
C:	yeah 
T:	yeah we can pops up another water problem 
C:	okay 
T:	okay well then I'll see you next week
