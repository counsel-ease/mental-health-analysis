T:	you Rachel it hurt coming today what brings you in
C:	well so I've been working with the weight management clinic and I just when I found out that this was an opportunity I thought why not use this as another resource to help me lose weight
T:	and why why do you want to lose weight
C:	well so really recently actually my older sister has had a lot of health concerns relate to her weight and it just sort of jostled me a little bit because we're so similar
T:	really related to your sister
C:	yeah so I've been this weight for a while but like now I feel like this is really the time for me to start making some changes
T:	what kind of problems sister experience
C:	well so she has some high cholesterol and high blood pressure and I guess those are things that were running my family but I'm really worried because my grandmother has suffered from a stroke and I definitely don't want to do that
T:	there's big change gears to get healthy
C:	yeah I mean another birthday rolled around and I just realized that I'm not getting any younger thank you thank you but yeah so there's some pressure there too
T:	so there's been some big things going on your life that's really prompted your push for weight loss so I just want to check it really quick and so on a scale of one to ten with one being really super important and have to do it starting today where are you in turn taken away
C:	oh I would definitely say a ten
T:	okay
C:	we want right now for me is really really important
T:	and what puts you out of 10
C:	just kind of all these reminders in the last year and then I'm getting a little bit older all of those things together make it a 10
T:	okay bad idea on in that same scale with one being not confident at all to 10 being super super confident where would you say your are in terms of your confidence to actually lose the way
C:	Oh honestly I would probably say that I'm like a five or six with confidence
T:	and what what promise you to pick a five or six
C:	I just like been tried to lose weight before and those things certainly have failed as I still I'm the same way
T:	okay
C:	that's what really only leaves me at five or six
T:	okay so what can we do to get you at say like a nine or ten level of confidence
C:	I think I would be more confident if I understood like how do you use some of the gym equipment a little bit more so it's not something that I feel really comfortable doing I just don't I know feel very confident when I'm in there except to use the bike and there are elliptical so some of that could be I would really like to do some strength training but I just don't know how
T:	okay that sounds really interesting
