T:	she is good to see you again 
C:	hello Doctor 
T:	so what's been different since the last time we talked a week ago
C:	well I did what we discussed I did the journal okay a week trying to mark down the the difference in my smoking being more aware when I would had the urge if I could stop the urge and I found it was okay it got a little bit scary on the weekend because the urge is kept on coming sure to have a cigarette butt during the week I was able to cut down at least two or three cigarettes a week and that's just in one week so 
T:	so you've been able to cut down by two or three cigarettes that's amazing I mean given how much you were smoking yeah you were able to keep the the journal you guys like you did that and that allowed you to really focus on the time when we were delaying your secret so so that's gone well so one of the things that are not going as well as you'd liked 
C:	it just seemed to get worse when it was the weekend right and I was going out with friends and I was home a lot of the day instead of at work and I found that it was really hard to stop those urges 
T:	ok so these automatic cigarettes when you're socializing and you have time on your hands really other problems that you're facing yes and that you've noticed other more difficult than the others 
C:	but I marked it in the book that's one thing I said to myself I'll be honest in my marking been walking down ok so I'm going to have to really be aware of the weekends maybe get some kind of hobby or join some group or something on the weekends to keep me busy 
T:	ok so and you thought about already what you might do is such as getting a hobby any other thoughts of what you might do to help you overcome this 
C:	if I could just postpone it ok and say okay I'm not gonna have it at home right I'll have it when i get to work or on the way to work that because I sure and then what I'd like to do is try not to smoke in my house 
T:	ok so from now to the next time you come back and see me what is it that you'd like to to work on  C	I think I just like to do what I did this first week I like the idea of marking it down ok so you can continue with that I and it took me a week and I i'm down to cigarettes a day I figure sure what I'd like to do is maybe go down to five cigarettes in other words another three a day okay and because I smoked a large pack in a small pack maybe just two small packs 
T:	you said five cigarettes this time yes and any thoughts about what concretely you could do to make that happen
C:	I can try each day to count right and I'm still going to try that when I get the urge to let it go fight it and maybe not goat for cigarette until the next urge comes right so if i look at it between two of them sure and also coming back and talking to you really helps because i have someone to discuss it with 
T:	so given what you're attempting to do when would it be good for you to come back and talk about this 
C:	I wouldn't mind coming back in a week again because this is all new and a week I can handle a week
T:	absolutely okay okay doctor will see you in a week yes thank you
