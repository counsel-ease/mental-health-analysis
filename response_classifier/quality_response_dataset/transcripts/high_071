T:	hello Becky
C:	hello
T:	my name is Jenny ponds
C:	nice to meet you I
T:	good to meet you and I hear that you met with dr. Johnson and you were looking at your concerns about wage is that right
C:	yes
T:	okay and how has that been for you
C:	very frustrating
T:	uh-huh
C:	I've been trying to get my weight under control over 15 years boy but
T:	it sounds like you've been working at it but this the years go by it gets pretty pretty frustrating
C:	yeah
T:	and and how um is your weight affecting life for you what's life like sort of where you are
C:	um well it crepe lot of pain I'm having problems with my knees recently had knee surgery me so it's really I know the physical pain has shown up that's that's the newest thing you know before it was about what I felt you know what I might look like now it's about how I'm feeling I'm older much older and the pain in my body the sluggishness
T:	so as the years have gone by it's it's it's becoming more and more of a problem
C:	yes
T:	yeah yeah okay and any other sense of how it's affecting the pain course is a very noticeable you know subject but anything else that you experience
C:	um like things you're able to do we able to do the same sorts of things well some of that I attribute to age but
T:	oh yeah right the cardiovascular as well yep
C:	yep yep so the biggest one that motivates me is the pain right now because get you away from it
T:	and you're in you know that if you lost some weight that then you'd have less pressure on those knees in you can be you
C:	can get around towns would make it too hot you know it doesn't take much just to to feel that difference unfortunately I'm going in the wrong direction
T:	yeah well it sounds as though you feel pretty strongly about this that you've been your back in here really wanting us to help you get something going
C:	yes
T:	so first off I have to hear a ruler rubens and if if you might indicate if you wish from a scale of 0 to 10 just how strong your conviction is about this being a problem you know just as you're describing it the pain and the concerns about your cardiovascular you know all of the ways that it's affecting your life okay from zero that it's really not that much of a problem to 10 this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed
C:	okay
T:	so where would you put it
C:	well I would say that hmm intellectually I'm probably at a nine and physically I'm in the tab
T:	hey all right
C:	yep so physically my body telling me every day
T:	why you say
C:	my mind just this needs to be
T:	and on what what do you think your mind is you know what the concerns are that your mind has are the are any doubts or anything
C:	well I'd say that that it's less because I because of a frustration because it feels like I ok I'm not committing to doing what needs to be done to get rid of the pain and take care of the body so it just doesn't feel like my intellect not knowledge but intellect
T:	or emotional baggage with your body
C:	yeah or otherwise wouldn't I be doing it
T:	yeah it's very close though
C:	it's much closer than the business much closer than it's ever been I mean intellectually have been that's what I've been stalling with cuz I've known what to do or thought I knew what to do and I would tinker with it but I didn't make the commitment and now my body says you gotta get it or you're going to be down to the count
T:	yeah absolutely um and nine so that's really quite high too
C:	okay
T:	attends the top of the scale with your body but nine with you not just your thoughts and feelings about it so what makes it a night and not a seven or an eight
C:	um the fact that something on my mind every day
T:	hmm
C:	and I know that making the choices is coming up for me I just haven't made the break through like I'll I'll realize that I've done something that was a good back right after the sack yeah I need to realize it before the back and then like could make the change uptake
T:	yeah that sounds like that's a source of frustration
C:	oh yeah
T:	yeah yeahs
C:	out of an internal fight
T:	yeah yeah if I could share a perspective that i have about giving what goes on with our mind and our body you'd be interested
C:	yo head okay
T:	well and this is just my theory but I really has a sense that you know we've got an appetite center in their brain right I'm part of our brain that regulates it might be getting messages about how much energy we have available probably a lot of other things too but basically that's monitoring our body to make sure that we're getting enough nutrition I think one of the challenges as we gradually gained weight and that's what happens with a lot of us know is that over time we gradually gain weight and then we look and we say well this is you know 10 15 20 pounds more than I want to be now but up here okay this this Center in the brain is doing its job of maintaining all those new cells okay you know it's going you know our job two days make sure that everybody gets fed and so we're working against something that's quite automatic in there you know the appetite that we have you know the appetite that we have when we have carb cravings you know I my sense of it is is that that's just something very very automatic Amanda but I also know that it's possible for us to especially someone with a strong conviction that you're demonstrating you know to to really start making some changes so maybe we'll explore for a moment if you like some of the things that you've tried and maybe your sense of what some of the things you you know might might like us to look into it now
C:	so i tried the you know looking at diets and of course any of that stuff always leads to putting on more way
T:	yep
C:	I've turned changing diets I've had major life changes where I'm not working anymore thinking that I would now have all this time to exercise
T:	and it's actually a more sedentary
C:	yeah especially because they have here i am the less i can move around cuz it's so painful
T:	so kind of a vicious cycle
C:	oh yeah and I was having got diagnosed with severe apnea sleep apnea and learning about all that impacts and now I've been on using machine for about five weeks and I feel the difference both emotionally and physically and they say it takes three to six months to even really i could feel even better than when i'm feeling now so this is definitely the time to make this change they say the lack of sleep to sleep apnea impacts wait
T:	I think it does
C:	so it's possible that was contributing to my you know to my weight gain
T:	yeah absolutely and then even just the factor that the apnea causes you to feel very tired during the day
C:	oh I told them a larger gym
T:	yeah you don't have that energy to beginning of the doing things
C:	oh just just the diet just so diet and I you know I five books I don't always read them with all the things to get all to try to change my mind around I've television shows about and it saved a lot of research wow I've done I've done the lazy persons research but but I you know I've been tuned into it and I've tried writing down what i ate didn't last very long
T:	can they keep it rising on us
C:	no no I think once i got realized how much i was eating i stopped writing um but yeah well that's really
T:	about it right on that i might share
C:	uh-huh
T:	if you're interested a book that i read a while back called why french women don't get fat
C:	oh
T:	and our goal isn't to be like french women but there are some things in in the in the diet in or lifestyle in that country that are different than the lifestyle in the united states and seem to contribute to better fitness and not quite so much overweight in the book she is a high school student exchange student going to the US and she encountered chocolate chip cookies and brownies and things could put a lot of weight on her and the amount of time look what just happened that must be must be youtube doing that I've all guys folks um and when she got back to the to France she'd gained a lot of weight went to her family doctor and he suggested that that's the first step getting that making a food log
C:	mm-hmm
T:	and then the perspective that he used was was to just find what he called the offenders we'd like one or two things that oh hi you know concentrated Swedes or concentrated fat and I see a not happening here then what what comes up driver when it I
C:	ice cream
T:	ice cream yep
C:	ice cream
T:	yeah ice cream I think pretty much is at the top of the list for all of us you know I swear that ice cream when I have it it just goes right to my hips you know it doesn't pass go doesn't go like two hundred dollars it just goes right there so have you had you looked into that as a possibility if so i might try to cut back
C:	oh yeah at times i have but i struggled a little bit recently and I um I was gone through ice cream consistently over a couple we carry then guess what my week when I just get so single-minded in focus that's when I go into the grocery store that's all I go for that's all I can think about
T:	mmm yeah I think it's really got that reward circuit in our brain down yeah yeah yeah yeah well is that something you'd like to cut back on
C:	Oh a little
T:	ill so you'd like to be I love I got ice cream okay
C:	and let the point one I I don't forgot to say no never but I'm at the point where saying just don't need it I mean I could go for two but buying it out of the grocery store it's not working for me it's not allergies
T:	only you're thinking not getting into the house
C:	yeah I keep it out of the house
T:	haha not come thank you a very good idea you are not shutting down will not let this happen I've already been with apple support it looks like YouTube needs a talking okay so ice cream is the goal
C:	yeah
T:	okay
C:	a leather go
T:	all right and in what would you say your your specific goal would be about ice cream that you really like to not have it in the house is that your main thing or
C:	not having a now yeah that's that would be huge to having it cuz that's really where I'm breaking down is when I bite it and I gallon put it in two days you know
T:	yeah and that's so easy to do because it's not filling you know and you know we it turns to liquid in our stomach to everybody
C:	I mean it for breakfast
T:	oh sure
C:	yeah
T:	oh absolutely yeah that is one of the strategies I used once I just have a little in the morning and burn it off you know and all that's doing is lighting that fire in there I don't know something ya
C:	got extreme hung up
T:	okay so the goal is just not have it at home
C:	okay yeah
T:	and how confident would you say you feel and again we're going to go back to as if you roll the clock 0 to 10 0 and 0 is you don't feel at all confident and 10 as you feel completely confident that you will be able to make this change if not having ice cream in the house and maybe we'll say Joanna for the time of you know an estimate of help for how long
C:	um
T:	week two weeks
C:	let's say two weeks
T:	yeah
C:	so I'm going to have to find a healthy choice to get when i get those urge for that ice cream and then instead of walking in the store going to present food i'll keep the ODI go the other way and pick up fruit
T:	yeah it's funny when I think it's hannaford here in Calais the ice cream is over that way and the produce is over the head okay no it's like making a right turn instead of a left turn
C:	it's an interesting it sorry
T:	yeah it's the right and it's the right way you go yeah young you could have a cup am i right yeah all right thank you let's take the right turn out of the right right whatever nothing yet
C:	um so uh do we could be the challenge to we could be a good challenge
T:	so why would you put your confidence 0 to 10 and i'll let you make a mark to feel like
C:	i'm gonna say a seven right now
T:	um
C:	just just because i can think of go right lots of cash registers between there and the foot the frozen food so if i get out before that
T:	um
C:	that would be good it would certainly if i die that was thinking about the pain and my loss of mobility can write that I hereby your ruler I can remember that if I go all the way the other way to the frozen food so I go left I'm going to have pain if I go right come on much better chance of feeling better
T:	okay
C:	and
T:	and that brings up an idea I might be able to help you with maybe next time we meet if you like
C:	okay
T:	and that is of course we'll check in and see how it was not going fun also there's a process called thought mapping that's a method where you walk yourself through step by step going into the store how you're feeling anything to do with feelings about ice cream and and you can rehearse in your own mind
C:	uh-huh
T:	making the right turn instead of the wrong turn
C:	peddling visualization like athletes do
T:	yes exactly and part of that yeah the way that they visualize they want to do that I left then I hi pole vault oh and they by picturing themselves doing it they actively Prix the performance improves
C:	yeah
T:	same story here
C:	okay I understood that
T:	so we might we might plan that or it sounds like you kind of got a sense of how it works
C:	yeah I'm familiar with visualization I'm good at all which is I think pretty close to mind mapping so so you think about it down the painful way and then you replace that with thinking about it with a healthier
T:	yeah yeah it's a little bit of a but if if you already it sounds like you've already got a sense of how visualization works on and you might be able to just decide say I mean what it makes sense to you even as you're young either in the car about to get it go into the store that you're visualizing yourself or maybe at home before you go out you know whatever makes sense to you you could even experiment a bit on your own
C:	oh yeah
T:	it works yeah yeah and visualizing now so I'm ever visualizing the fruit you know and having kinds that you really like you know and if you like variety you know one make it as enjoyable as possible but you are so wise to come up with that idea of substituting something you know putting having something else in place of because when we just take something away something else in the brain goes 0 or you're taking my you know it didn't
C:	ya
T:	I'm going to have this instead this is much better
C:	yeah
T:	and I should check the time for measures when we are I get 15 minutes
C:	I hackathon and over here
T:	we are on not seeing oh yes we are i think we can stop ok so i will look forward to seeing you in a couple weeks and
C:	yeah
T:	wish you well
C:	thank you very much do we have to attract a great plan going here ok
