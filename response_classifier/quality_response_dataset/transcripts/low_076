T:	I would also like to ask about some health habits that can contribute to high blood pressure. Do you smoke at all?
C:	No I don’t smoke. I smoke as a young adult, quit  year ago, I went cold turkey, proud of that, haven’t really thought about smoking.
T:	Do you drink alcohol and including beer or wine
C:	I do drink beer, I drink  or  times on weekdays, sometimes on weekends, maybe  or  Cancel me like the increase in your drinking could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. 
T:	I'm concerned about the amount that you're drinking currently it sounds like you're having about  to  drinks per week. It’s definitely more than what we would recommend and could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. 
C:	Well my pressure has been high for years, 
T:	Well according to your chart your blood pressure has gone up since July and you said that you've been drinking more recently so do you see the connection there. 
C:	Maybe a little bit
T:	alcohol can have some dangerous effects on your body so long with contributing to high blood pressure can have a big impact on your liver would you need to keep in mind so your liver has several different roles in your body for acid helps process excess fatty acids before they get distributed to the rest of your body and also helps process Alcohol and Other Drugs so when you have an excess of alcohol your liver can't work as efficiently and the fatty acids build up an overtime your liver won't be able to work as well. 
T:	How about the use of other drugs like cocaine, hyrewen, marijuana? 
C:	I don’t use marijuana cocaine, and I’ve never thought about using the hard drugs. Back in school,  years ago or so, I smoked weed, once I got out of school, I haven’t used that at all
T:	Have you ever used any prescription medications they weren't prescribed for you or in a way that wasn't prescribed?  
C:	No I don’t really like the idea of taking pills, as a matter of fact, a couple years ago, I had this jaw surgery, they give me the prescription of … I took one, maybe felt wired, they still sit in the medicine cabin. 
T:	Ok, it sounds to me that the increase in your drinking could certainly be contributing to your high blood pressure. I think decreasing the number of drinks that you have when you go out and maybe decreasing the number of times that you go to the bar each week could be the best thing that you can do for your health. 
C:	I guess I’ll try. 
T:	And then we'll set up an appointment for about a month from now will recheck your blood pressure and see how you're doing with all this.
