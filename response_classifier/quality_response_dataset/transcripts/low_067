T:	it's for your disk lipid e mia oh yeah just one tablet a day do you have any questions for me?
C:	no I guess not 
T:	all right great have a good day 
T:	hello kaleigh I'm Lori the pharmacist here at bulldog pharmacy I see that you have a new prescription for cholesterol Staten  called in by dr. Ferris today I wondered if you had a minute to talk to me? I just want to make sure that you know how best to take it and if you have any questions? 
C:	sure I'm just getting a few groceries 
T:	okay what did the doctor tell you cholesterol sadness for?
C:	well he told me that I had a blood test for cholesterol and that I should start taking this 
T:	he's right this medicine is designed to help lower your cholesterol and that means that it will help lower your risk of having a heart attack or a stroke how did your doctor tell you to take this medicine?
C:	you didn't really tell me you just phoned it in 
T:	okay well you're going to take one tablet of cholesteryl sent in twenty one time a day by mouth and you can take that with or without food when do you normally take your medications? 
C:	well I take all my other medications right before i go to bed so I guess I could take it been 
T:	okay that's perfect because cholesterol stenton works best if it's taken at night though you can take it anytime of the day and you should take it every single day it's important to keep that up where do you store your medications?
C:	I store my medications in my nightstand right by my bed all right do you have any children in your home no 
T:	okay well then that sounds like a perfect location for you medicines keep best if they're stored away from light and heat and moisture what did the doctor tell you to expect in terms of side effects?
C:	he didn't mention anything about that 
T:	all right well this medication is pretty well tolerated which means it doesn't have very many side effects but you might experience some mild muscle aches and pains if they seem really severe to you then you should call dr. Ferris and talk to him about that also this medicine can interact with a lot of other medications and even over-the-counter things so check with the doctor or myself before you start anything new and lastly grapefruit juice can interact with cholesterol Stan  so if you use grapefruit juice every day I probably would switch to a different juice while you're on this medication just so I know we're on the same page can you repeat back to me how you'll take this medicine?
C:	sure I'm just going to take one tablet right before I go to bed with my other medications and I guess I'll switch to orange juice and if I notice any muscle pain that is severe I'll call dr. Ferris right away 
T:	great Kaylee I know we went over a lot today what other questions do you have for me 
C:	I think you answered all my questions thank you fantastic 
T:	all right well here's your prescription I even put it on auto fill for you so that it will be filled for you every at the same time every month and if you have any other questions later our phone numbers right here on the bottle and you can call me at any time thanks so much have a great day
