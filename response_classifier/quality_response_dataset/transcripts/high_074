T:	hey Marissa it's nice to see you again I'm really glad you came back I am this is about our second session and last session we kind of talked about you and some just a little bit about you and we left off about you know where what you and your friends do on the weekends and you had mentioned the alcohol so this session I thought we could talk about what you do on the weekends with your friends and you know how much alcohol you guys are using and kind of stuff like that does that sound all right yeah good so let's get started so can you tell me a little bit about what you guys do on the weekends
C:	we have parties the days we drink I mostly parties being thrown like dance around a big crowd other weekends just a few of us or hanging out watching movies
T:	okay
C:	so it kind of depends on the activity if alcohols involved or not yeah
T:	okay can you tell me a little bit about the difference a pleasure you get from the weekends you're drinking alcohol to the weekends you know I
C:	I mean a party is more energetic but obviously tiring after but in the moment like it's fun and you're dancing around you're drinking and having fun but then over just watching movies it's kind of more calm relaxing but sometimes kind of boring
T:	okay so there's kind of some pros and cons to both sides of drinking and not drinking
C:	yeah
T:	okay so what are some of these things that you do like about alcohol
C:	follow me drink we usually have more fun a little bit more loosen to relax but don't wanna drink too much obviously that can be bad
T:	mm-hmm so it sounds like when you're drinking a little too much it's kind of turns into a bad time but you just drink you're right about the right amount or just a little bit you're have fun with your friends and you know not not getting into too bad of situations that's not about right so what are some things that you don't like about drinking
C:	a lot of time it just makes people like stupid make dumb decisions but we try to be as safe as possible like staying at friend's house so you don't drink and drive or are having like weird strangers come over and put things in your drink or won't have with that
T:	okay so you're saying thank by staying at some friends houses and you know kind of watching out on trust when you're drinking alcohol and but you're you know something so I'm like they're still kind of happening and even with after kind of planning us out
C:	yeah sometimes
T:	okay can you tell me a little bit about that
C:	um I just felt like when when I'm me or one of my friends drinks too much and like we end up puking it's just not fun when that happens
T:	yeah peaking definitely outside I can just can't imagine the feeling so I'm sorry you had to experience that
C:	yeah
T:	can you tell me how often you have thrown up from drinking alcohol
C:	just once for me it was the first time I'd ever drink so I just drink way too much I didn't know what I was doing mixed in all kinds of alcohol I'm just drinking what everybody what anybody would give me and that didn't end up - well Eisley so after that I haven't really I still have friends that throw up and drink way too much and I have to take care of that take care of them so that's sometimes kind of a downer
T:	okay so on one side some of the things with alcohol or you know it creates you to be a little relaxed and carefree and have fun to dance but on the other hand you know there's a little bit more cleaning involved to be safe about it and sometimes you know you drink a little bit too much and that can cause it down on your night for you or you know how to take care of a friend
C:	yeah
T:	okay so earlier you had mentioned that a couple times that you had had to some decisions with limiting your alcohol and you know that make it as safe as possible why don't you think that you uh did that
C:	well I have an aunt that's an alcoholic so I see like the drinking issues and I know how bad drinking can be like I've seen movies and things and I just want to be safe and being a saint setting where I can let loose like a parents house like a friend who's cooler so I mean I'm gonna have fun but I want to limit the dangers I just want to make sure that when we're drinking and that we respect like so ever somewhere in
T:	yeah but something you kind of get a good head on your shoulders and respect must be a big value to you
C:	yeah I think it's important to respect others and then get that respect in return
T:	okay so do you think that drinking kind of fits in with that value or how does that fit in with your value of respect
C:	well I think drinking is kind of disrespectful to your own body because you're putting things that shouldn't be in there and I respect myself by limiting my drinking and like staying at someone's house to be safe and just limiting my actions of who I hang out with when I drink
T:	okay so you're kind of looking at balancing you know how much you can drink with some positive benefits without crossing over to those negative sides so what have you come up with at this point do you sort of stick to a limit
C:	I mean I make my own drinks and I like exactly how much is in it what's in it so I can control it like I'll make one drink to make it last as long as possible so if somebody comes up and it's like here I have this drink I'm are I'm like I'm gonna die already have this and I'm still able to let loose
T:	okay so you pretty much it feels like it works for you and you kind of have it spelled out where you know it goes smooth so you're sort of balancing that and sometimes do you ever exceed that limit
C:	for the most part it works really well I still have come people people come up to me like at a party and pressure me and I'm just like no I'm good I've already had some that have my drink but sometimes people be like take a shot and then like everybody gathers in the kitchen and takes one together so sometimes like that I'll drink too much
T:	okay so a portion of the time it's working in the other portion the time it's kind of like you just go with the flow
C:	mm-hmm
T:	okay so kind of thinking on those lines how important is it is it to you to make some changes or adjustments to your drinking when you're looking at your values or maybe your future plans
C:	in terms of like respecting my values and body I'd like to drink less cuz it's nice to let loose enough fun but I don't want to you know like damage my body I have my friends on boards I can work with that like the peer pressure to drink more like the shots so for right now I don't really know if I can quit cuz all my friends are drinking
T:	don't do your friends peer pressure you
C:	sometimes but I mean I think they'd support me if I'm trying to quit
T:	okay so you may find it hard to stop drinking completely because they're drinking around to you but if you might find it easier if you just lessons about of drinking but your friends wouldn't support you either way it sounds like
C:	yeah and hopefully maybe they'd even slow down on their drinkin
T:	yeah won't be no good for all of you guys to kind of do it together so you kind of have a goal to set back them out of you drink how important is it to you maybe on a scale of one to ten one being the not that pour in at all so you tend being the most important thing to you right now
C:	I'd say like a six or seven like I'd like to work on it if I can get around to that I don't I don't
T:	okay so why would you pick a six or seven may be compared to a four
C:	I mean I think it's important and like I know it can affect my body and wanting to be a doctor in it health is going to be really important to me and it can affect my social life and schoolwork
T:	okay so you're just kind of making those changes when you feel like it's gonna fit ninto your life
C:	mm-hmm
T:	okay so looking ahead you kind of thik that drinking wouldn't really help you with those goals
C:	yeah
T:	okay so how confident are you that you can make these changes on a scale of one to ten one being not confident at all and ten being the most confident you've ever felt
C:	yeah I mean if I had decided that I was going to do it for sure that they attend
T:	Wow so 10 is pretty pretty big so why do you think you picked a 10
C:	because I mean I know I can do it it's just making the decision to do it
T:	okay so maybe you had mentioned you'd like to cut down but you have to have the right timing and it's got to be you know 100 percent you're doing it
C:	yeah
T:	okay so what else do you think you could do with that how could you you know cut down on your drinking
C:	I was thinking about talking to my friends no I don't want to sound dorky but like let's stay in tonight and not go out or just be like I'm not gonna drink tonight but and then I want them to be like okay with that like okay with me not drinking
T:	okay so sort of you know playing activities that might not include alcohol as much and kind of getting your friends on board with being okay with doing this alcohol or those activities without alcohol okay so do you feel like this is a goal that you could maybe set and be willing to work on
C:	I think so
T:	okay well would it be okay if we met for the next couple weeks and kind of worked on this goal together
C:	yeah I think WR
T:	okay well your commitment to changing you know kind of this behavior and you know making a commitment to chat really shows that you're going on to the next step and you know making a change for you know maybe the better for your life if that's what you know it's for you so does that sound like that's kind of right
C:	mm-hmm
T:	okay so I'm just gonna do a little summary it sounds like you're kind of studying big goals for yourself like becoming a doctor and graduating high school and go to college and I'm really looking forward to you know see how you do and I think you'll do great and looking forward to school and it sounds like you have a pretty good social life and you know you're pretty active in sports from what I heard earlier for my last session and that all these benefits can help you you know maybe from cutting back on alcohol with maybe you know bettering your school performance and really helping your health and you know possibly you know helping you find belonging with your friends without having to have alcohol and also it's really exciting to have a really good plan in place as long as you're willing you know I would really like to be real working with you
C:	okay
T:	all right well I'll see you next week
T:	all right well Dana I want to welcome you back into my office I appreciate your willingness to come back this week it was really a pleasure to get to know you a little bit last week and I really do appreciate your willingness to be so vulnerable with me I know it's not easy to just spill your guts with a stranger so I really appreciate that is there anything that I can do right now to make you a little more comfortable okay well as you know you're more than welcome to use the restroom if you need to while we're having our conversation so if you do it's just right around the corner I also want to briefly remind you of our confidentiality rules and I told you last week that I always just like to reiterate that everything you say in this room will be completely confidential the only reason that I would have to break that as of course if you were to tell me that you have an intent to harm yourself or anyone else so last week you talked a little bit about what brought you into the office excuse me and why you're seeking treatment with your use of marijuana um I heard you say that you're having increased difficulties with your asthma as a result of your smoking yes is that about right
C:	yeah
T:	okay well you're a primary care physician thought it might be helpful for you to come talk to me a little bit about your asthma and your use of marijuana because he's I think he's worried about your use of marijuana with your condition which you agreed to come speak with me so am I on track here so far
C:	yeah
T:	okay all right well perfect well since we discussed a little bit about your history last week I want to begin this week by discussing the cravings that you experience and maybe what we can do to help cope with some of those cravings in other words maybe develop some alternatives to smoking do have these cravings how does that sound
C:	sounds all right I mean I'm not really sure how I'm gonna be able to do that but like what exactly do you mean
T:	okay well let's just start a little bit by talking about your cravings the cravings themselves when you wake up in the morning you start your day when does a typical cravings start for you
C:	about the second or you that wake up
T:	okay can you tell me a little bit about what that's like for you
C:	so it kind of makes me feel real calm and relaxed when I smoke and it kind of keeps me relaxed throughout the day so I continue to smoke you know to keep that high and you know just helps me not stressed about work
T:	okay so the types of planning that we typically do to help these cravings include components of reminding ourselves of maybe the negative consequences that come along with these behaviors so another component would be to find alternatives to this solution so when you wake up and think who I know I'll be more calm throughout the day I'll be more relaxed at work maybe could we try to remind ourselves of the negative consequence that we discussed last week like I'll be more likely to be late to work if I sweat this morning these are just some examples of some ways that we can help remind ourselves throughout the day to maybe combat these cravings but I know maybe that's easier said than done like I'll wake up and just tell myself that it won't be beneficial you know sometimes that's easier said than done so another thing that we can do is find very specific alternatives to the smoking so we could look at other activities that may provide this relaxation and calming feeling that you're describing would you have any ideas about I know we talked a little bit last week and you're going to think about maybe some alternatives were you able to come up with thing
C:	I just don't really know how alternatives are gonna help me avoid smoking
T:	okay so I hear you say that you don't see how discussing alternatives will help you stop smoking
C:	exactly I mean I'm enjoy doing things but not as much as I'd enjoy when I smoke
T:	okay so nothing else that you can do will relax you as much as marijuana does
C:	yeah I mean there may be some things but there's nothing like that right now that I do that relaxes me as much as marijuana does
T:	okay so what would it be like for you if we were maybe to just explore some new activities or new techniques that could provide you some relaxation
C:	I'm really not good to change or trying new things
T:	okay well that's understandable change is hard and it's hard for a lot of people if trying something completely new would be too difficult maybe we could find something that you've tried in the past or liked in the past I don't want us to choose anything that would be uncomfortable for you so let me ask maybe what kinds of activities have you done before that brought you the sense of being relaxed and peace
C:	well I used to be a big runner but I stopped running about maybe eight years that'll go
T:	okay I know you mentioned last week that you started smoking about a year ago would it be fair to assume that you stopped running around the same time you started some anything
C:	yeah I'd be fair to assume that I guess
T:	okay so you said that you were a big runner what role did running play in your life
C:	I just kind of helped me wind down after a long day of work I'd go on a run after work and it kind of helped me to decompress
T:	okay so it sounds like running really helped to bring a sense of relaxation to you
C:	yeah I really did it kind of calmed my nerves and made me feel better about you know just about everything
T:	okay so what let me ask you what would it be like if we were to bring running into your life again
C:	I guess I haven't really considered that option
T:	okay well I want you to take a second and imagine what it would be like for you to running what would that look like if you were to imagine that
C:	honestly I'd probably be much more relaxed after work and I wouldn't be able to smoke right after you know something worked like or something I've done you know that has stressed me out
T:	okay so Dana I'm hearing you say that running brings you a really great sense of calmness would this be something we could set as maybe homework for next time like in between our next session now in our next session for you to try running again to replace the calmness smoking brings to you
C:	I think so it might take me a hot second to get started up on you know running a long distance
T:	okay well I appreciate your willingness to consider it I know you said it's a bit awhile and it takes some courage it really does to get back into something that you haven't done and as maybe has gotten a little unfamiliar so I appreciate that
C:	yeah I mean it'll be hard at first but my doctor has actually been telling me that running would really help me with my asthma you know
T:	okay well perfect that sounds like that's really would be a good fit to improve your asthma which is what brought you here in the first place and then maybe help you cut down on the smoking does it sound about right to you
C:	yeah I mean that sounds about right it's kind of it's on all pages for everything
T:	okay awesome I'm wondering if you'd be willing to do something else for me so we're gonna try the running and I'm wondering if you'd be willing to journal maybe after a run so say if you chose to run three days after work next week just jot down a couple things like what it was like to start running again or if you were to think about any of the cravings or just your treatment in general just what it was like to go running again for you Kasana you mentioned last session that you really used to love journaling and reading and so that's why I bring it up because I know you used to enjoy your journaling
C:	okay yeah I mean I actually probably like that because I did journal a lot about you know just random things and that was just about and stuff so it'd be nice to maybe get back into that
T:	okay and journaling helped you
C:	it it kind of did it was I mean it helped me like sort out my stresses
T:	okay okay well it sounds like we have a solid plan in place how are you feeling right  now about our plan and today
C:	I feel really good about it I know I've been wanting to get back into both running and you know journaling and this will help me kind of with my stress but you know and it's kind of a big opportunity to start making changes and you know I want to get better because my Aspen it's really kicking my butt and I want to start exercising more maybe stop smoking
T:	okay well I'm hearing you say that you're excited to try this is that what's out there
C:	yeah kind of excited kind of kind of weird okay
T:	well I want to thank you for being so open and honest with me again today just like last week you know it's hard to just open up to a stranger so I thank you again for that and I'm really excited to try this new plan a few Dana I'm excited to grow with you and help you in any way that I can in this journey so next week we'll review your journal and discuss kind of how running was for you and hopefully maybe help them with these cravings and divulge a little bit into that a little bit more how is that sounding
C:	sounds pretty often
T:	okay well how does next week about the same time same place
C:	yeah sounds good
T:	okay well great thanks for coming in
