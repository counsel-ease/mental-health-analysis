T:	hi Alex my name is Tony I'll be your nurse for today how are you doing
C:	I'm okay I guess just waiting for the stitches to come out it would be nice
T:	okay tell me a little bit more about this firefight
C:	okay story time you rate this so proud my girls having a fantastic time looking off on fleek and ish and then this girl like she has the nerve to stare at me from across the room it gives me this kind of it come on like this and then she comes up to me she bumps into me she spills my drink and she comes up and then she's like there man so I'm like excuse me so obviously I pushed her she pushed me kind of thing and yeah one thing led to another all right so it's a blur from that point on but all I know is that cops showed up I'm here and I have this to deal with fantastic great
T:	okay from what I'm getting here is you were intoxicated at that point in time and then you had a confrontation with this girl which led to the bar fight and
C:	I was more than toxic it Oh smash oh you should have seen it but like this type of thing doesn't happen often so I don't want you to be sitting here and referring me to some AAA because yo I'm not an alcoholic
T:	okay so it seems that you can't offend that they feel offended you refer to me
C:	yeah I'm not an alcoholic no I'm
T:	okay because it labels you guys mom
C:	yeah exactly
T:	over yeah all right of all we do have some time right now if it's okay with you I wonder if we could talk a little bit about your drinking habits
C:	yeah sure no
T:	I do you what is drinking you for you would have
C:	yeah well you know being 25 that's what we do like we get together we'd hang out we get a couple of drinks it's me and my girls we do this all the time and I love this it breaks the ice when we go socializing so meet new people kind of thing you know girlfriends circle it's it's fantastic and it definitely relaxes me after a stressful week and my weeks are so stressful is I need this you know so I mean yeah but just so you know I do drink responsibly and I never drink and drive and I don't intend on doing that
T:	okay so to me this is our drinking is your way of relaxing with your friends is your way to socialize and it breaks that I guess right it helps you socialize and you know I'm I also wanted to say that experience I was responsible of you to be drinking and not driving
C:	thank you
T:	how does it affected your life
C:	who has it well I mean now that this happens I do have it because of that bar fight and he's gonna be disappointed so I guess you could say that my relationship with Henry it's been great fantastic but he says that when I drink it's like I'm not myself it's like somebody has never met before and obviously you can imagine the arguments the fights and oh my god all that stress it's just I love him so much but you know but it does stress and that's like I don't forget to make it it it's just
T:	so for my understanding drinking it helps you socialize his friends it relaxes you it's you know here we have just you know it breaks that ice for you on the other hand it's causing that a lot of arguments of do you and your significant other Henry
C:	yeah
T:	and it's causing a lot that that all those arguments are completed you a lot of stress in your relationship this manager
C:	yeah I mean we're engaged you look pretty this is well I don't like you put it that way I mean I'm worried because what's he gonna think of me later on the link once again I tell our children all your mom is an alcoholic she drank this and they go into fight I don't want I don't want anyone to ever think of me that way but at the same time I mean I don't want to quit cold-turkey I mean you must understand how hard this is for me to even be here and talk about it but I love him so much I mean I would do anything for him and he's gonna be so he didn't even say I don't know how can I face him
T:	this seems like a little Brady lucky died to have someone who loved him that much
C:	mmm boy seriously he's not gonna find anybody that loves him as much as I do trust me on that it's not gonna happen
T:	so what I'm getting here right now is that if you just want to quit
C:	yeah
T:	yeah and it's just partly because um but this alcohol is the leading to the arguments with Henry and it's necessary relationship
C:	yeah
T:	I noticed over a year there and I know you don't really like like the idea of it but what do you know about it eh like what's one shift of light on that
C:	it's a place or alcoholics go to discuss their problems and like I said I'm not an alcoholic
T:	mm-hmm well you're right there for multiple walks of life and they share their drinking stories and everyone just kind of helps each other through this journey if you can so prayer together
C:	okay
T:	I don't even want to join eight at this point in time
C:	okay
T:	mom's but hypothetically speaking would you ever consider joining it
C:	if this is what I have to do to get my guy back and I'll do it
T:	mm-hmm okay well on a scale of 1 to 10 I'm 10 mean like for sure and 1 being not really sure about it at all what would you say where you are on the scale with 20 an 80-acre know that you
C:	put it that way and everything I told you I would say 6 yeah
T:	why would you say sticks instead of say that's really I mean you're really adamant about not doing anything
C:	well it's all about it's all about Henry at the end of the day it's it matters to me if I want to keep disengagement and I will do anything for that man so of course this is what I have to do this to do this is him live including his relationship with me and it's so much more important to me than drunk in a bar I'll tell him that
T:	yeah so right now we're sitting at a six what needs to happen stated maybe we can jump that to an eight or nine
C:	um you know like flexible hours maybe if that isn't even an option um also maybe there's maybe if there's a place nearby somewhere like nearby my house I'll be great so off to waste gas its expense I already go to work and it's far anyway and um like I guess I guess it has to do with attitude as well I don't want to sit there in a circle like this and somebody judging me because the way I look and my drinking habits and all of that so I guess I'm just looking for a good vibe you know I don't want to be judged not labeled
T:	yeah all of these are like really understand aborning it's just of course you want something I mean you need to be close to use you don't have to commute so far and
C:	yeah
T:	we all have very busy schedules
C:	yeah
T:	the fish is very busy sniffle and Emily makes sense and of course the environment I mean if you're not happy they're just an even and learning and if you're not comfortable in it and it's very hard for you to
C:	yeah
T:	you know to be in that environment
C:	yeah
