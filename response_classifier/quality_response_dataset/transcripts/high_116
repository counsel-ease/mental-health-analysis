T:	so Rose thank you for coming in today can you just start off I tell me a little bit about yourself
C:	oh yeah i'm a student right now at U of L will not right now i'm taking a little break from school um i live at home with my parents and I I work out I mean right now I'm not doing too much but on college 
T:	it's your typical college student 
C:	yeah 
T:	well it sounds like you're really really happy about your life I can tell with your facial expressions and things like that you seem pretty content to be taking a little bit of time off from school right now and you know that you live with your parents sounds like you really enjoy spending time based off what you're what you're telling me 
C:	oh not really I do like my family a lot but i kinda want to be back at school I mean I guess I'm kind of friendly person um but yeah I don't know I like starting out of my family for sure I always like to call you home for Christmas and summer break all that kind of stuff but I'm kind of aggravated because here I am my junior year i'm really excited as it gets missing year and graduate and now i have to take another semester because i had to take out this one and I'm really grateful that my parents are like you know letting a little bit them but they are making me look at the same time um so yeah I I got sick a little bit and they asked me to come home and I thought that you know I can get better and i I just I don't want to take any more time off really I want to stick to my age and a graduate on time like everyone else my age so it's aggravating I that I am grateful that I have a family like them I guess 
T:	so it seems like you're kind of conflicted about what's going on you know I'm hear you say that you got sick and it wasn't really big deal but it seems like your parents may have been your opinion overreacted 
C:	yeah
T:	kind of pulling out of school was causing you fall behind what you would like to be 
C:	yeah i mean everyone gets sick i mean i don't think it's important for me to stay home for that reason you know they may to always be concerned about my health I feel like I think they're a little overly concerned 
T:	can you tell me a little bit more about what you mean by sick what kind of symptoms and you have what did that lead to 
C:	well I just kind of always been more easily able to like colds and stuff and it always kind of got worse for some reason for me i'm not sure why but I you know I just it just kind of happened and so I expected it when I got to college of living has lots of random people in dorms and I knew they'd be like freaking out on it and they of course were finally by sophomore year and it wasn't getting too too sick you know I guess some days at work a couple days of school you know every other month or something but junior year I don't know I guess they thought I was getting more stressed dollars I don't know I'm kind of guessing here but um yeah so my symptoms i guess like you asked we're kind of getting the common cold i guess but i would just get really exhausted and sometimes like everyone so i won't be able to get out of bed but 
T:	so it sounds like you're really confused about why your symptoms even began 
C:	yeah i mean just I feel like I'm a pretty normal 
T:	I know that you really discuss that working out was it really important part of your life it's safe it can you tell me a little bit more about that?
C:	well I want to be a personal trainer that's kind of where I am right now like that's why I wanted to stay on my agenda because after school I have to do like a few more years of school getting my masters I'm really excited about that like I mean I've been reading like magazines for training like since I could remember and it's all about you know being fit and being excited about being fit and having like I energy that kind of stuff which is hard when I'm sick time high energy but I always going to work on my own fitness lifting weights and running and doing extra classes just to kind of build my core that kind of stuff so you know I I think that's kind of why or got so much it's really important to me and one day I'm gonna have to encourage you with the workout so I need me they'll love it myself so 
T:	well def don't want to be hearing that is this this is probably one of the biggest parts of your life and you know what you're saying and I don't even frustrated but you've been unable to do this inject home 
C:	yeah
T:	because of the illness and your parents concerns you know you express that you really like to work out every single day how many hours a day on average would you say that you work out?
C:	I mean they encourage like what I read is like four arms but like I really want to be a great trainers I'm you like five or six so I know it seems like it I'm like
T:	you're like time consuming it is 
C:	yeah I mean I like a friend come running with me around smile but a sort of certain point they don't want to keep running with me or like workout me good so you're not a little socializing but I mean it's what we want to do with my life so I have to get used to it one day i'll be doing it for like  hours a day
T:	so well it seems to give a lot going on with your life I mean taking that amount of time during a day to run I know it would be very exhausting so I can completely understand that getting the cold may seem pretty doable to you I know that you were referred here by your primary care physician dr. hafer and I know that your parents were just really concerned with not only the amount of exercise that you were doing that maybe also some of your other eating habits yo Mike us try to talk about tonight you can't be a little bit why you think that they're concerned about that at all?
C:	I mean compared to like my siblings on Michael little thinner so I guess that's probably what they're thinking but I need a workout I want to be fit but I I really watch what I eat you know I mean that's what they disease I'm een and you know I'm not just magazines for more than that it's Boca soon yeah videos and come on part of many blogs and that kind of stuff you know what I hotel my own but you know they just really encourage watching 
T:	how much fruit you have how much about how many vegetables you have how many you know how much mean you have?
C:	and so my parents had concern when I have very little meat and when I'm you know when I'm just consuming fruits and vegetables so that's really where they're concerned I guess they want that's must be what it is I mean they think I don't consume enough of anything so they tell me but I mean if you look at like these agendas that I have been following other people survive you know by that most the time so I mean so when I guess
T:	I'm hear you say is that you're really you're following with the magazines and what the internet what all the other fitness experts are saying right it seems like your parent ships aren't fully understanding that that's just the regimen in the lifestyle that that industry village drives for and they don't follow themselves so 
C:	I mean they're not going to understand that they've never been really concerned about it I've always kind of encourage them to kind of comment down the heat but you know it's something that yeah I've read these things I and I want to be competitive one day as a trainer and getting other people to be competitive too so I they think us here original question was what was it again I'm sorry I kept rambling I'm nothing 
T:	you're doing fine you can continue on as you were we can sort of his head in the direction of I know you really discussed a lot about fitness and working out as one of your really important aspects of your life will you have some of the other important aspects of your life?
C:	um well like i kind of said my family and i really do care about them and so they're very important to me and my schoolwork is very important to me i really try to do well Matt just try to focus my time on that and I also do a couple hours of work everyone everyone's valid during the week at the library so I try to put those hours there just because I need to make the extra money to pay for you know I'll do all the things that I following magazines and my groceries because the campus foods one of the most i joined by our groceries absolutely 
T:	well it sounds like you are incredibly busy as a college student John sleeping 
C:	yeah 
T:	it's something that I think would be very beneficial for the next week before we meet again it's I would like for you to try to do your best to journal kind of document maybe how your day goes you know in the morning what are you doing in the in the afternoon what are you doing it at night time where you're doing just just breathe little notations you know seven o'clock i'm doing this eight o'clock i'm doing this not every single hour but as often as you can remember I'm and I'm likely to bring that in next week for us to discuss that way we can kind of see how your schedule is going around real quick
