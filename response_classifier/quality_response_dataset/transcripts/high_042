T:	I just I do today
C:	I'm alright I'm going a little weird lately and I can't explain it I'm just I feel off you feel off I just feel really often not like myself and just not like I'm normal like I think that normal person should be feeling right now
T:	you're not feeling like a normal person should be feeling
C:	I'm feeling a little anxious a little jittery a little I I don't know I just I just feel weird
T:	I said you have some anxiety but you're not really certain of the feeling
C:	yes yes
T:	okay I want to ask you a bit of an unusual question that is going to take some imagination to answer I want you to bear with me if you can okay so let's say that we we know you have this problem describing this partially anxiety based at least say that you were to go home tonight and attend to usual chores and you're to go to sleep so you're asleep and sometime during the night miracle curse and the problem you're having right now and its entirety is gone so the next morning you wake up but you don't know the miracle has occurred that makes sense
C:	it makes sense
T:	so at this point as you wake up you don't know the miracle has occurred how would you recognize the problem is going
C:	I think I would just feel better like I don't know maybe not be jittery you know I can't be
T:	jittery
C:	yeah maybe I mean I don't know maybe I would just I would just feel better on the inside
T:	I try to try to think that's good trying to think specifically like you first wake up now let's go through let's go through your day say first wake up this miracle is occur but you don't know it's occurred
C:	okay
T:	so you don't know about the miracle you wake up believing that you would still have the problem
C:	okay
T:	even though the problems not there
C:	okay
T:	so let's move through let's move through the day and see when you would be able to recognize or what you would recognize so it's different
C:	I think during the first half of my day I just it like when I wake up I do all the normal things I make my breakfast shower shave all that stuff and I generally don't feel jittery then it's just when I start to actually go out of the house and just thinking about getting to work and stuff it starts to just get a little jittery on the inside
T:	so you may not notice the problems go on when you're still home
C:	correct um but I think that once I actually got like to my office space I think that that's when I'll start to say hey you're you're you're not filling all jittery your palms are not sweating you're not being you're not really anxious about going into work today and something just starts to click and it's like hey this is just feels right instead of this feels wrong and I should here or I shouldn't want to feel like this alright
T:	so the moment you get to work is when you think you'd really recognize that something about the problem has changed that it might be gone
C:	I think so and I think more I would actually understand or see the miracle had occurred is actually when I started to interact with my co-workers because I think that there that's where a lot of the jitteriness occurs or at least that's what I've been noticing that I'm seeing that anytime I'm really starting to interact with my co-workers that I my heart starts to raise my hand starts to get sweaty I I don't know what to say I don't know what to do and I think that if all of that started to disappear then I think that I would notice that
T:	so that moment when you start to interact with your co-workers you would you would notice that you're not reacting in the way that you're used to react
C:	correct
T:	which sounds almost like almost like intense anxiety or panic will you describe it
C:	I I never really thought about it like that because I think that that's something that this naturally always been happening and it really never occurred to me to look at my work situation to see if by eliminated that or those people that all of the anxiety would go away because I think that even though when I come home I'm still thinking about working stuff is still happening and I'm still worrying about how I'm going to work with these people that I still have a little jittery but I'm not as jittery or sweaty or whatever especially when I'm at the office
T:	so so the largest chance you're going to recognize the problem is going is during that in the office first really so there might be an after effect that you would it's going to be absent on your way home
C:	correct
T:	but you feel like the symptoms the problem are really strongest at the often
C:	correct yes right yes I would say 100% yes when I'm especially when I'm interacting with this people it's specially large groups of people I think that that's when it really pops in and it just I just don't know what to do with myself and I think I could see that if I we had a say a group meeting um I think I would really notice that them because I wouldn't be worried about what I'm saying or how other people are viewing me or if people think I'm dumb or anything like that I think that it I would just be able to say what I needed to say
T:	so the problem wasn't there you'd be relaxed and confident during these meetings
C:	yeah I think I would be I think being really confident and also I would be very short myself because I would know that this is what I'm saying it's right what I'm doing is right and I wouldn't have to worry about if my coworkers talking about hi my bag or if my coworkers laughing like I wouldn't even care if they're on their phones because I know that what I'm presenting is going to be round alright so
T:	it it seems like I've used to this question which we called a miracle question
C:	okay
T:	it seems like it's helped you to identify what's going on a little bit it sounds like a social anxiety type symptom that they have going on
C:	okay all right
T:	that's something we can certainly work on perfect and maybe it's giving you some insight into how that social anxiety seems to function throughout the day when it's more intense at work less less intense as you come home and in the morning we wake up really it doesn't seem like it's too bad at all so it's giving you an idea how those symptoms I've been flow through the day and what they might mean what might be causing them
C:	mm-hmm
T:	so it makes sense
C:	that things could complete that's I think
T:	we'll work on it don't work want to put some more framework around it but give that some thought what's going on the problem in terms of when it occurs you kind of you're recognizing habits work and reflect on that a bit and then I'll see you again about a week and we'll start moving through and see what we can do about the social anxiety
C:	okay perfect
T:	that's how good Jeff
C:	that sounds wonderful
T:	I'll see you then thanks a lot
C:	thank you
