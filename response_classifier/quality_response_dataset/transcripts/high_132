T:	Harriet I'm happy to be here 
T:	oh it's so good have any way so you know hi study  weeks what do you want is the end it's a really big baby this big you're looking so good from your desire it's wonderful 
C:	yeah thank you 
T:	yeah I know you mentioned last time about the drinking of the alcohol and certain things about that we did cover certain things that can happen when you're drinking now can I ask you a very broad or open-ended question apart from alcohol fetal alcohol syndrome what are some of the other things that you that might happen to you or your baby if we keep drinking during pregnancy 
C:	I know there are some problems but I'm not quite sure all of them 
T:	I would like you to go with that with me again if it's possible 
C:	oh yes
T:	it's good to we just keep reiterating on what's important well apart from fetal alcohol syndrome there are some pretty serious conditions that can also come in because if you're still drinking for a start you can get malnutrition it can interrupt your whole metabolism you actually lose your appetite a bit and some of those really important minerals and vitamins that should grab the bag of you and your baby you're going to miss out on so that's going to be one of your big problems and it can also upset your fertility for next time around and not many people realize that so your whole cycle can be pulled out and you might try have trouble falling pregnant again so there's some pretty serious side effects apart from the fetal alcohol syndrome that you might find affect you in your baby also too they found in some recent studies that the baby can be bored very restless and unsettled so even if it doesn't get fetal alcohol syndrome a lot of clinicians say they can see a baby that's been born to a mother who has been drinking during pregnancy there they actually unsettled hard hard to rest though they that they don't follow the normal patent of a newborn 
C:	yeah that's sounds pretty awful 
T:	yeah 
C:	it's not something that I want to my baby to live
T:	so we really need to work on some strategies down that way so and then probably my next target with you is to talk about how brave you are an affirmation of how brave you are to come in and tell us all about just how this drinking is affecting you and the fact that you want to stop yeah thank you
C:	it's it's hard it's hard um I drink to relax and i think it's it's a habit that emits for a long time and once i get my first doors it's hard to stop so yeah and i've heard some from some people saying and some friends told me that it wouldn't be good for the baby but i don't know it's just hard and 
T:	it's so proud of you two coming because a lot of people won't even admit to it let alone come until the Midwife what they're doing when they go home so it's just so very brave of you to come in and tell us all about hey drinking and what we can do together to try and help you stop that 
C:	yeah I don't know I was thinking about maybe if I put some signs for myself around the house especially in the frito whatever just to remind myself that drinking is not good for sure and I don't know the other thing maybe just don't have the first dogs 
T:	yeah absolutely if you don't have that first if you can stop yourself having that first drink you're more inclined not to keep drinking of course
C:	yeah 
T:	it's wonderful you can't have the strategies you so far
C:	that's wonderful yeah I think I might try 
T:	that just many want wanting to quit smoking you don't just remind yourself all the time and don't have the first don't have the first and don't start don't start 
C:	so yeah this is my strategy for the moment I don't know I would just have to try and see how it goes and I'm glad that I can talk to you what so the next time I can tell you what had been doing this period in if I was succeed or not 
T:	I said if it sounds wonderful it's really important to that I reflect on your feelings that's all all part of this and from what you're telling me there's a great sense of guilt and frustration with what you're doing is through its draw 
C:	I don't want to do that but it's sometimes it's stronger than me 
T:	oh yeah but you're coming up with these wonderful concrete and practical strategies on how you can attack it 
C:	yeah now that I know that it's affecting my baby I think that's one of the things that I think it's going to be my you know pop I will get them some strength from that from that knowing that it's gonna harm my baby and so and I put some signs for myself 
T:	um it's gonna harm your baby 
C:	it's gonna hold a waiver morning also yeah just fantastic 
T:	I just want to summarize now because it's so important because this is such a profound topic for you to talk about and it's really important that I've taken on board everything you've said now we've been through I know we've been through apart from alcohol the syndrome that we've talked about in depth we've talked about other things that can happen with you in your baby if you continue drinking we went through all of them one by one and you seem to get a good handle on on those things because you're able to repeat them all to me you told me that you felt this great sense of guilt and shame about the whole thing about drinking but you have no problem talking to me about it which is wonderful and then you came up with these wonderful strategies that you can up with yourself how to remind yourself that it's bad fit with the signs not if you don't have the first drink your lesson plan to have the third of the fourth so how to stop yourself having that first drink you think is how you get these changes so so that's wonderful so I've understood where you're coming from do you think by summarizing little 
C:	yeah yeah yeah 
T:	oh you don't yeah it's totally absolutely dead fantastic I just want us to elicit now some change talk and he did talk about those strategies that you were going to do yourself which is exactly what we want we want them to come from you because they're going to work for you is there anything else that you can draw on to make those things happen to stop your drinking no not at the moment not that I can think of but I'll certainly be more aware keep their end up in my mind so if any other strategies that I can come up with i'm going to write it down and bring it to you when we can have a gentle dead 
C:	okay
T:	fantastical thanks for coming in today
