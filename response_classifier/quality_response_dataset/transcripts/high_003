T:	hi John
C:	hi Justin I'm dropping off a new prescription
T:	no problem I have this in stock but I do notice that these prescriptions from the hospital can you tell me more about that
C:	yeah I was in the hospital for about ten days I had this infection where the fluids are oh I need my refills they didn't give me any new prescriptions in the hospital
T:	I did have some auto refills for you in the pharmacy unfortunately to return to stock since you weren't able to pick them up but if you give me twenty minutes I can get them all ready for you
C:	I twisted my ankle leaving the apartment this morning it's hurting real bad
T:	that's terrible John asbestos in your first day coming back from the hospital but I did want to talk to you about one thing the ibuprofen is you're holding especially with your medical condition will have a tendency to reduce blood flow to your kidneys
C:	really but they told me I couldn't take Tylenol but I thought that ibuprofen would be okay at the hospital when I first got there they said my kidneys weren't doing too good but when I left they said everything was back to normal
T:	well if you don't mind John if we can go over to the side area and I can discuss with you further kind of see your ankle John
C:	sure
T:	does look swollen does it hurt anymore mark when you move it does
C:	no it's the same
T:	I think the best thing for now is to get a cold pack and elevate your ankle to 45 degrees let me grab that for you real quick so this is the instant cold pack so just basically to activate it you just squeeze in place it around your ankle and elevate it to 45 degrees and the reason why I feel more comfortable with this recommendation is because you've told me about your kidney problem in the hospital I really don't feel comfortable with you're using ibuprofen and because if your liver condition the fluid is pooling in your abdomen which is restricting the blood flow to the kidney ibuprofen will further restrict blood flow to the kidney and your blood pressure medication the lisinopril there's normally a very good medication that will further reduce blood flow to the kidney and the total effect of all three of these factors will drastically reduce buffer to the kidney and the kidney failure and that's why I feel more comfortable with the cold pack recommendation and if you have further questions we can talk to your doctor
C:	thanks for letting me know about this I certainly don't want to hurt my kidneys I got enough problems
T:	that's why we're here and if you want to walk with me back to the pharmacy I can get all your prescriptions rung up for you you
