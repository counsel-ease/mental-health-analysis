T:	Good afternoon, this is April from the pharmacy, could I speak to Faith please?
C:	This is faith.
T:	I see you haven't picked up your prescription this month. Are you having some problems with it?
C:	Are you talking about my Avenex?
T:	Yeah.
C:	Well, I haven't been taking it for the last couple of weeks. To be honest, I took it for a year because my neurologist told me I should, but lately I haven't seen any reason to continue doing it because I don't feel better and I don't think I'm doing that badly.
T:	Who' your doctor?
C:	Dr. Livingston. He' my neurologist. I think I remember him saying something about it slowly the progression, but frankly April, I don't know what that means. He doesn't explain things very well, and if I ask him, he doesn't take the time to answer my questions.
T:	Have you had any symptoms lately?
C:	No, not really.
T:	Do you have any problems taking the drug?
C:	I'm not crazy about taking the shots, but that's not the issue.
T:	Are you having problems paying for it because we can help you with that.
C:	No, my HMO covers it.
T:	I'm not sure I understand what the problem is.
C:	Well, like I said, I don't see the point of taking this drug. What's it doing for me?
T:	As it says in the patient education kit you received, it reduces the risk of a second attack by over forty percent. The clinical data is very strong.
C:	Well, now you're sounding just like my neurologist. I still don't understand what that means.
T:	Well, Avonex provides a thirty seven percent reduction in risk of progression to sustain disability in two years and a forty-four reduction in risk of developing a second relapse in up-to three years.
C:	Okay?
T:	Are you interested in reordering your prescription?
C:	No, not really, I, I think I want to think about this for a while.
T:	It's important that you stay on it. There aren't really many options for MS.
C:	Well, maybe we have to wait until something better comes along.
T:	My expert opinion is that you stay on the medication until it does. Until newer drugs are developed this is the bet e have.
C:	Well that's depressing.
T:	Well, only if you think about it that way.
C:	Yeah, okay. So are we done?
T:	Unless there's anything else I can do to help.
C:	No, thank, bye.
T:	Okay, bye bye.
