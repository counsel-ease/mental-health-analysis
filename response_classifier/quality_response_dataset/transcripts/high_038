T:	what's going on what are you feeling right now
C:	um I'm feeling disgust to Scully about what hope I can't do this like you can't do this
T:	so so tell me what that feeling of disgust is what are you disgusted about
C:	uh just my body like just I don't know I feel like eating that just makes my body feel you know gross
T:	mm-hmm
C:	uncomfortable I don't know
T:	yeah well it sounds like there's some judgments in there right so it sounds like probably you're having some judgments like I'm feeling really bad yeah
C:	yeah
T:	that sort of thing
C:	yes
T:	but but you did say it more descriptively which is great which is you're feeling uncomfortable right now
C:	right just eating that makes me feel icky I don't know just
T:	yeah and I can totally understand how you get to there if you're thinking I'm feeling fat I'm going to get fat you know it's an easy place to get to okay
C:	okay
T:	but I feel like we're missing something too because I don't think it's just discussed I think there's another primary emotion in there what do you think that might be
C:	well I feel like just looking at that I that cake I feel like I just want to run out the door I just I don't want to be here
T:	sure so what what emotion do you think that is
C:	being afraid being fearful
T:	yeah
C:	of what will happen if I eat that
T:	I think that's exactly right that's what I'm seeing you know I see you kind of curled up over there you know you have a very worried face you know and you're having a hard approaching it I think I think that's absolutely right that you're feeling fear and I want you to know that makes a lot of sense to me you know when's the last time you've eaten cheesecake
C:	I honestly I can't remember I don't know
T:	I know it's been it's been a really long time he certainly didn't need it all through you know when you were really stuck in your eating disorder you know I used to
C:	I used to like it I remember that but it was such a long time ago and uh
T:	and so you've been avoiding food like this for so long that it totally makes sense that you're feeling fear
C:	right
T:	and you had said this is one of the hardest foods for you so that makes sense to me
C:	right so just see it like as a big blob of fat
T:	right
C:	that was that it looks like to me
T:	that's what what what is that it's a big Wobbuffet
C:	no judgment
T:	yeah exactly you know I'm not gonna let you get away with saying stuff like that all right
C:	okay
T:	so because that's just not going to be helpful right now so what I'm wondering is since we know that it's fear that we're dealing with maybe if we can do some opposite action to that emotion do you remember what I mean by opposite action
C:	mm-hmm
T:	what do I need
C:	instead of wanting to turn and run away from the fear of eating this and just you know check out basically right you want me to go towards it and you know just experience what I'm feeling and not go away from it
T:	right exactly so you know fears associated with that urge like you said to run out the door so instead of running out the door we want you to approach the thing that's scary which is this cheesecake right now right
C:	right
T:	okay so I see how hard it is for you and I honestly it's hard for me to watch and I wish I could just take that away but as you know the reason opposite action is so important is if you if I just take that fear away by saying no more cheesecake it's just going to make you more fearful the next time you come in front of some kind of food that's tough for you make it work yeah so by doing this hopefully over time your fear all go down okay
C:	okay
T:	so can we have the fear right now and still take a few more bites all right
C:	okay
T:	let's do it so how was that
C:	it's difficult
T:	yeah I can see how difficult it is
C:	what I'm doing it but it's not football
T:	exactly
C:	doesn't feel comfortable
T:	no I wouldn't imagine it would but you did perfect opposite action right there which is you are feeling really uncomfortable and I can tell that but you still did it
C:	right
T:	do you feel a little bit proud of yourself
C:	yeah
T:	yeah
C:	a little bit
T:	okay so this shows me that you can do it so let's try again let's take a breath and then we'll go back and do more opposite action
