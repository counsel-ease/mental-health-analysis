T:	so Jane it sounds like you're angry with your supervisor would what would I be right in saying that
C:	well I think I'm pretty angry
T:	all right look maybe to help me understand you know more about that anger I'm wondering if you could you know choose two or three pictures here that look like how you were angry at the time which which of the cards here that would show how angry you were okay don't I might just take a look at those okay it does look like anger doesn't it it's a pretty big anger so after you'd had that you know a big thing with your mum you you went to your room right
C:	well she got really angry at me because on the way to my room my idiot sister got in the way so I pushed her out of the way she's just annoying so then I went into my room the only place that I really feel safe slammed the door and then mums favorite picture fell on the floor
T:	thank you for sharing that with me because it really and being for being so honest about your anger because what it does is help I don't know if it's helping you but it's certainly helping me to understand that this is really big for you and it's a big expression but surprisingly you know anger anger's a good thing in a way because it's it's letting you know that something wasn't right and wasn't fair that he he just did change the thing without your permission without you knowing so in some ways you had a right to be angry but what happens what I heard you saying in as you were telling me what happened next what happened next was that your anger took charge and he it did more than what it's meant to do your your anger is just just to let you know that you're angry okay but what it did what I feel it did it just pushed you out of the road and said I'm I'm taking control here so Jane when you were angry did you feel it anywhere in your body
C:	well my neck is really sore and its really paining and and my shoulders I just it's really like it's it just feels like I've been I've been hit by something
T:	the end of the day that that pushing your sister over and yelling at your mum did
C:	it's made it worse yeah
T:	yes which is hard to see at the time I I do understand that but what I'm thinking is that if sometimes if we tell our anger look thank you you've done a good job it doesn't have to get so angry then because you you know you you're telling it that it's thank you you've done a good job you've let me know I'm angry now I'm going to deal with it from here
C:	you have to help me with that a bit i think
T:	we will
