T:	exam looked just fine so the only thing I'm still kind of worried about is the stomach problems and we'll keep our eye on those the labs that we drew today will get those results back to you as soon as they're available all right good now before you Dooley today i noticed that you did fill out our alcohol questionnaire is that okay with you if I look over that?
C:	sure well 
T:	thank you so just briefly looking over this let me first verify what you're drinking? and how often? that sort of thing so we're on the same page what is it that you typically drink?
C:	just beer just beer no just regular beer 
T:	so I have a picture here this shows what a standard  ounce beer looks like is that what she'd say you're drinking typically? okay so  ounce beers how many days a week are you drinking?
C:	um most weekend I guess about three days a week on average 
T:	okay about three days a week and on each of those days how many beers are you drinking in a typical day?
C:	four or five sometimes a six-pack all right no more than that 
T:	so up to a six pack three days a week all right so based on that information that you've given me and then also looking at your questionnaire here I have some information that i can give you as just a way of giving you some feedback about your drinking is that okay sure with you okay well your score on this was  so if you look right here on my card a score of  places you in the high-risk room category yes sir so this means you are at higher risk for problems developing as a result of your drinking that could be accidents or Falls or even health problems like damage to your digestive system that sort of thing what do you think about that?
C:	well I sure wasn't aware that I like drinking with my friends and relaxing on the weekends at home watching TV some of my friends really do have drinking but I don't drink like that 
T:	so for you this information is not only knew but it's really surprising yeah too and it could be that drinking at the level that you're drinking could be directly related to the stomach problems that you're talking about today what do you make about that information?
C:	well I don't know what to make of it it's surprising it's news to me 
T:	I hear that I can understand that and like you said for you drinking with your friends is enjoyable and on the weekends at home helps you relax I'm curious what on the other hand would be some of the not so good things about drinking alcohol for you?
C:	well okay thank you vineyard it hasn't caused any adverse effects that I'm aware of I'd never connect the stomach issue with drinking 
T:	so you see really no need to change your drinking? C	no not really 
T:	okay well for a man your age in this high risk category it is recommended that you actually cut out drinking altogether to reduce that risk what do you think about that?
C:	well I'm not sure what to think about it I never considered not drinking I'd never thought that that what to me seems like a small insignificant amount of drinking is I never thought of that as being a problem 
T:	well it would definitely be my recommendation if you could even cut back you know half of what you're drinking then you'd cut that risk in half and again it's recommended that you quit all together and I would definitely suggest you work on that 
C:	well I'll certainly think about it and I appreciate the information okay well 
T:	thanks for listening thanks for discussing this with me 
C:	sure thank you
