T:	Jeffrey tell me what you'd like to talk about today? um press all you can call me Jeff the time 
C:	um I don't know there's just so much going on right now hey I lost my job two months ago and I don't know I was like taking care of myself so much better and it's just I stopped going to church as much and it's been really tough because my wife and my two kids aren't living with you right now so I'm just trying to get my just kind of get trying to get myself together right now and so I mean you're the first person I've seen it for days I just don't know I just don't know what to do
T:	okay so right now what you have so much going on that you're just feeling totally overwhelmed you don't even know where to start yeah thinking about trying to control your diabetes just seems like one more 
C:	yeah I did likely from like a bun on a job like how can I think about you know check my sugar and I regular basis I'm trying to just get out of bed you know and not sleep till pm like I've been doing you're even feeling a little bit depressed right now yeah yeah it's not helpful 
T:	so it sounds like you mentioned that you had been going to church and then you also said that your wife and kids you're not with them right now so sounds like the people that you had in your life that men were a source of supporter there aren't there for you 
C:	yeah hmm maybe that are there hurry i don't i don't know i mean that's part of what I'm scared about is you know what if they aren't there like one thing that was really cool his on Wednesdays me and a few my friends would walk the Bible study instead of driving and it was fun and one of the friends was named Cheryl and whenever I didn't go she'd call up would be like so you know she'd always get me to go and just I didn't want to let them down i also really enjoyed it so we just talked about work I have a job now but I mean we just I don't know we just talked about life you know it's really good 
T:	so that group is really helpful to you not only just to kind of chill out and have a good time but also you actually had some exercise 
C:	yeah exactly get into n out of them had diabetes as well so sometimes we were just Chad you know see if people were you know just taking care of themselves get into the clinic doing whatever they needed to do so I missed that you know 
T:	okay so that was a really helpful thing for you in managing your diabetes and you're feeling a little bit lost not having that 
C:	yeah yeah I just I just I don't know I just it's just it's just tough because you not only do i miss my friends but i also miss being a good husband and being a dad and and being able to provide and just I mean I had to get fluted the church food pantry you know two weeks ago and you know it shouldn't be like that i should be able to support them and to you know work hard go to or come on you know cook dinner help with the homework i mean i'm not doing any I have no structure in my life right now you know I I mean I could add sleep in till pm because who cares you know
T:	it sounds a little bit like you're feeling a change that you can't fulfill this role that you it's not so much ashamed
C:	it's just embarrassed you know it's like I I I mean even just saying this I'm kind of like hope you know that you don't judge me or whatever because I did I can't even it's hard to even just say this I don't want things to be like this you know it's hard enough sometimes having diabetes and being embarrassed around that but throw all this other stuff on and it's too much I just don't even want to acknowledge it 
T:	really you know you're really frustrated because they fell anything's going on in your life that you feel like you don't even have control
C:	exactly exactly yeah i mean at least i had control as far as going to work going to charge um taking care of my family i mean those are three things that helped having those in balance i could focus on my diabetes because it was as part of my routine and i got ready for work you know like those just part of my routine 
T:	so in the past we were able to have the structure and also the support of people around you it's sort of added more daily basis it was easier for you there's a lot easier
C:	yeah it wasn't easy but it along or I just felt like I could deal with it 
T:	okay so even though you're really overwhelmed right now and everything just sort out of control and you're feeling really really hope it sounds like you may have identified a few things to think about in trying to figure out where to move forward all right did work in the past right now
