T:	so how are you today 
C:	not bad I guess thanks 
T:	pretty good actually added well let me introduce myself properly mines colon I'm one of the registered nurses working here at the center I particularly work with clients or thinking about changing their behavior in some way but I should address you Bob what name would you prefer mr. Jones
C:	no no I'm I'm Nathan I mean Nate well Nate and my friends call me Nathan so much anything and it is um 
T:	so okay like see you're a coach or something like that or
C:	well you know that is a good way of thinking about I'm certainly not going to be coming to the gym with you or anything like that oh but sure thinking about as a coach bird would help 
T:	yeah so I wanted to get started if as a few things we just lay out before we get going yeah so my understanding is that you're here to talk about your substance use and i do want to point out that anything that you say to rise will be kept confidential and in the sense that we don't discuss your business needlessly i do share information with other members of the healthcare team and if they tell me anything that it sounds as though you rather pin yourself at risk imminent risk are putting someone else at imminent risk of harm or indeed that a child might be at risk then I do have a statutory responsibility to do something about that okay is there anything I've said so far that you want to ask about
C:	no 
T:	I i understand it sounds good i mean i understand so yeah yeah well there are some specific questions that we ask of everyone boomer and doing this first kind of a meeting Nathan but before getting to that I'd like to put that aside and begin just by hearing from you like what brings you here well
C:	um I've kind of been messing up the last little while and I've kind of got myself into some trouble because because of that to tell me more about well I'm sorry i've ever been nervous sir sure it's quite understandable to be nervous coming in to talk to it like this yeah um okay well I've had some job interviews and I've kind of I've missed those and and you know I've really not been too happy with myself the last little while you know I'm kind of getting angry really quickly and and I mean people that I love and like people I normally don't get angry so you know it's it's kind of bothersome 
T:	well quite a few things going on for you there then the idea that you've been getting irritable we've been hurting people that you love even and and you mentioned also missing some job opportunities so some work opportunities 
C:	well yeah um yeah because I've been kind of partying hard and well honey my wife gets upset about that and Dicky 
T:	so could you tell me more you've been partying your wife's being an upset with you well going on 
C:	well the thing is okay so I'm I don't have a job I'm unemployed and you know I've got some free time on my hands and I'll be honest with you I've been kind of a little bit down because that and I thought you know my friends been trying to get my spirits up and so you know we've been out partying and drinking and stuff like that but that's not been the only problem that's the thing well I mean you know drinking's been a problem I've been drinking too much 
T:	so you think that perhaps you've been drinking too much
C:	yeah but but that's not the only thing I mean I'll be honest with you i've been i've been doing cocaine as well and and then you know of course that leads to more drinking and and you know more cocaine so I'm I'm just trying to think of you know maybe I should cut back on the coke and kind back on the cold 
T:	well you've given me a lot of information so far but some of the things that have brought you here ma'am you've talked about not a bit missing job opportunities you've talked about and be getting irritable and the noticing you had been different and even hurting people that you love you've also mentioned that you've been drinking a bit more part in a bit more and also using some cocaine and I'm wondering what would it be helpful for you to focus on today athan what would be good for you to talk about now 
C:	well I mean well yeah that's that's about it but I guess it'd be kind of like trying to get the the coke situation a bit under control and because it's getting out of control out of control yeah I know some people that are worse than me but thinking of it worse but what has been the worst thing that's ever happened to you since you've been or when you were using cold hard things um I guess the worst thing is that you know I've been doing the coke in and 
T:	well okay 
C:	I'll tell you about this one situation that it's kind of scared me a little bit is that you know I've done some coke and some booze and like lots of it and I remember this one time I was in the car in the back seat and the driver done kind of the same thing you made then some coke and some booze and and it was is is pretty scary and you know and I was really really high and he was really high and we were driving and it kind of just hit me and it was scary so so good sliding is very scary yeah well I mean I'll be honest with you there's there's been other times that you know I've kind of woken up the next day and I don't even know where I was I mean and I don't even remember so it's not remembering it I must be scary to it to not remember things yeah I guess not remembering is has been that's definitely scary and then you know being in situations where it's been really dangerous sometimes it gets foggy and you know yes this is going to sound kind of silly but you know sometimes the only way I can find out what I've actually done is by going to my facebook and then finding out because other people have been talking about it or I've seen pictures and stuff like that and that kind of jogs my memory and then when I start to see those things I kind of wish I hadn't done them 
T:	so so quite a few things going on then it's you know you've suggested it from Europe for your copious so you're not remembering things that you know you're putting yourself at risk and it's scary for you 
C:	yeah and you know I guess because I've been putting other people at risk too and I you know I love I love my wife and and and I love my family and I and my friends and I want to do something that's it's right you know that I'm really going to regret
T:	your family your wife your friends are all really important to you 
C:	very very important 
T:	thinking about importance Nathan how important it be for you to make changes to your core cues
C:	well I mean eight I don't know it you know eight out of ten if that's you know that makes a lot of sense 
T:	yeah it's good to use imaginary scales absolutely so so for you ten would be the the most important and deal with people yeah okay yeah so you're roughly eight 
C:	yeah
T:	I mean it's very important to you then I wonder why is an eight and not let see a four
C:	well I guess because it's been big causing me problems and you know I've missed some job interviews and and I don't even know you know kind of what I've done you know until the next day or you know You Know Who I am I you know I've kind of been been hurt you know by my friends and stuff like that and and you know in influence I guess in a bad way from from them and you know and then of course then you know I've been having problems you know sleeping and stuff like that and you know not getting sleep and sleeping properly and you know and then all of that kind of falls back and it's upsetting my family and and
T:	so sorry it's like there really are a lot of good reasons for you to to think about changing 
C:	yeah yeah I mean one of the reasons why I come here is I'm thinking because the cocaine in my mind the cocaine is the issue 
T:	mm-hmm 
C:	and I'm because it's a vicious cycle with the cocaine and drinking and I'm hoping that maybe if I can somehow you'll resolve that then maybe maybe like I won't be drinking as much like I'm okay I'm not an alcoholic I mean and you know just it's it's a problem with the cocaine 
T:	so and certainly our labels aren't alcoholic labels aren't important what what what do you know about cocaine and alcohol and how they work 
C:	I I'll be honest with you I don't know much I mean I've read it a few minor things on the internet but I mean I get confused about that
T:	and I guess one of the issues that I really wanted to highlight is that when alcohol and cocaine get used together which is reasonably common but for among cocaine users and what actually happens is that when alcohol and cocaine mixed together they form a third substance and actually has some surprising effects it can stay in your system a whole lot longer and can also give you a feeling where you don't feel as drunk as you would normally do and sometimes that means you can drink to excess and not even realize you've done it 
T:	Wow I mean I didn't I didn't even know that it's surprising well you know see the thing is that that makes a lot of sense because that kind of that makes that makes more sense because it explains why I end up spending more money and you know and having no alcohol left and in in the house in the morning and stuff like that and
T:	wow what else do you make of it
C:	well I guess it means that I really need to stop one of them and ain't gonna be the beer 
T:	I guess so for you if you were to stop one it'd be the cocaine it's looking that way I mean I guess especially if you know if the alcohol and the cocaine makes like you say they doing and all that so thinking about stopping how confident are you that you actually could stop if you wanted to you told me earlier was very important to you 
C:	but I was
T:	how confident you are and I may be again in an imaginary scale of  to  where  is the most confident one is the least confident 
C:	well I mean I'll be honest yeah I'm not that confident about it I'm I don't know on a scale of one to ten maybe  maybe maybe five four are like yeah for 
T:	so there's somewhat competent then I wonder whites for and let's see no a one 
C:	I sure I could stop I mean it's just that you know there'd be a lot of temptations you know when I go with my friends I mean a lot of my friends use but I guess 
T:	so a lot of your your friends use and it could be quite tempt and you're sure you could stop 
C:	well yeah I think so I mean I mean I could tell them 
T:	I suppose there are some things you could do to help yourself stop then
C:	yeah I guess so I mean I can avoid certain bars where I know it's easily available and 
T:	these are great ideas Nathan you've told me quite a lot this morning so far and I Anna certainly want to hear more about your your own ideas about what would help you to stop I'm i did mention earlier that i had some specific questions to ask you and I wonder if now might be a good time for us two million if I summarized everything that's been said so far and then maybe we could switch back to these specific questions how would that feel for you that work 
C:	okay 
T:	yeah that's okay yeah okay let's let's do that then okay Nathan so you've told me quite a lot of horrible things that have been happening since you began using cocaine and particularly become concerned about your recent years as you've noticed that your moods been quite irritable that you're hurting people that you love that you've been missing opportunities for work you've not been sleeping very well you've also told me that you've been taking some finished off at risks and that scares you and also not even remembering sometimes for what you've done which i guess is also really scary you've told me it's very important for you to start using and you've also indicated that you have some confidence that you could stop in fact you've even come up with some strategies does that sound about right to you
