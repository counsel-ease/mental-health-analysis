T:	I know so you've got a surgery coming up soon and I see from your form that you're a smoker okay so you need to know that smoking before surgery can cause serious complications and it can delay wound healing so you're really going to need to quit now are you hearing? you know you have to quit now if you don't you're putting yourself a considerable risk of a poor surgical outcome 
C:	well I don't think I can quit right now because I'm too worried about the operation kind of stresses me out plus we've got family staying with us and everyone smoks in the house and 
T:	I get that Noah but you're having surgery for cancer you got to do what's best for your health and you got to tell your family not to smoke around you then it might not be so hard to quit okay assume that means you agree? so I'm going to range for some nicotine replacement for you and I'd really like to see a quit within four weeks it's really the only option you've got to take responsibility for your own health okay we'll chat more next time I see you
