T:	I wonder if I could raise the subject of your weight what I wondered if we could spend just a couple of minutes talking about your weight you are joking Arnie
C:	I mean look I've made time in my day to come here 
T:	yeah I'm kept in your waiting room for  minutes 
C:	yeah it's not acceptable you know that I'm making a point where I'm  I expect them to sit down at  not quarter to  
T:	right and you so you're busy enough 
C:	yeah I've got other things to do I got pants to do
T:	I've got clients to coming in 
C:	yeah you know and it wasn't necessarily easy for you to make the time to come down and you had to wait in the waiting room and now I raise the subject of wait 
T:	yeah I mean okay fair enough 
C:	I've got to have my blood pressure the Oh medication change but I really haven't got time to talk about my weight I mean you know I'm aware of my weight I'm aware of the problems and I'm also aware of the solutions so I don't really need a discussion it's it's just I've got too much to do at the moment you know 
T:	right and so it's it's it's been a bit of a rush for you coming in 
C:	yeah 
T:	and I'm sorry about the wait in the waiting well it's been it's bad form you know yeah yeah that's and that that's not easy for you because you you'd like to go really soon and Here I am asking you to spend just a couple of minutes with me 
C:	yeah but basically I've got things to do I'll go back to the office I've got a pile of work that I've got to deal with yeah and every time every moment out of my day yeah means I have to work in the evening against 
T:	it counts when you're self-employed you ain't got a choice
C:	exactly exactly
T:	it's up to you just a couple of minutes
C:	well I'm here now so yeah okay if it's a couple of minutes 
T:	yeah I promise okay because I really must get on I want I want to simply ask you how you feel about it about what what losing weight
C:	well obviously I want to UM yeah I mean who doesn't I mean I'm aware that I'm over my balance weight but I know that it's causing problems I mean obviously I get out of breath if I have to do something about Harry and I realize that I'm on this blood pressure right and maybe that's probably contributing to it 
T:	right you can see the links between your weight and your health and you'd like things to be 
C:	yeah I mean there are other things but I mean yeah the weight is a something I would like to get hold of
T:	you get on going to handle you'd like to if you could 
C:	yeah I mean I know that the theories of a bit of exercise on a regular basis a balanced diet but unfortunately because of my lifestyle because of being self-employed as an accountant it's finding the time to exercise but also finding the time to sort of think okay I'm going to go shopping for this that in the other yeah prepare a meal yeah with me it's very often ready meals and that sort of thing yeah yeah food on the run you know grazing let me see if I can
T:	summarize what you've said and then we'll see what next and you lead a busy life yeah you run a business and you've got a lot to do yeah and you you're aware of that of the links between your health and your weight and you are concerned to some extent about that and ideally it sounds like you'd like to do something about it it's just that your life is busy and rushed and you tend to use convenience foods in order to get the work done 
C:	yeah I mean I to a certain extent because of my lifestyle food is just fuel yeah yeah you know because I'm juggling all these balls and I don't want to drop any I get it I get it 
T:	and so if you could fit it in you would like things to be different but that's not so easy no okay can I suggest that you come back and see me in a couple of weeks time just to chat about this okay I'm up for that but it's going to be the same problem of a finding time and B if I make an appointment
C:	I don't expect to be kept waiting for half an hour there whatever because it's exactly 
T:	I tell you what might be a nice solution is if you come down first appointment and I give you an appointment at  and anger then they'll be absolutely no waiting and the purpose of that of that visit will be to have a look at how you really feel about how you could move forward and somehow fit in a more healthier lifestyle into the busy work life that you've got I'll maybe have a look at my schedules see whether anything can be arranged or I can pass something on to some and and so right so it's not a wasted interview so I come here so I've looked at my schedules I've looked at things good whatever good and see if you can fix it up and also give some thought to what we've talked about yeah of course good stuff 
C:	okay okay thanks sorry I went up a bit
