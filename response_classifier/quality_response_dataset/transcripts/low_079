T:	Hi Liz will thanks for meeting with me today so what's something that you'd like to change or work towards  C; well, I’ve really been thinking about working out lately, I really want to start working out again, It’s been on my mind, and I know I need to do it. It’s just getting the motivation to do it. 
T:	and you’ve been talking about that a lot lately, So I really feel like this is something you need to do soon, because a lot of time there’s just a lot of talk, but there’s no action. And if you really want to see results, I guess it’s something that needs to be done and stop being lazy about it and just do it. 
C:	Well I don't know if I'm really being lazy about it I think it's just that I have a busy schedule yeah I just need to find the time to do it and yes I might be laughing a little bit of motivation but I think it's more time again trying to fit it in. 
T:	and it sounds like a lot of excuses to me, and you have shared with me before that you do have a gym membership so that’s just something you need to fit in your schedule. So for you to see results you want, my guess is that you need to go about  to  times a week and really fit in that hour workout on a daily basis. 
C:	But it is part of the problem is that I don't have  to  times a week to do it or an hour or even I mean hours the long time cuz if I'm working out for an hour that means I'm leaving home to get there time there time back I mean it's not just an hour it's the two hours realistically and. 
T:	and it seems like if you really want to see the results you have to put the time in and if it’s gonna take you two hours it’s gonna take you two hours. And again, if you want the results you need to start and you need to start now. 
C:	well, Okay..
T:	I;m looking forward you see you tomorrow, and I'm hoping that you are going to be able to tell me that you went to the gym.
