T:	mm-hmm so your mom interrupts what are the race some of the reasons that she interrupts you probably from you throw something away go to track and one where she was nows on the opposite side of the house and let's I think that's the main one so your mom asks you to throw away things unnecessarily do something that
C:	she I know she can do because my foyer oh brother can do it and she's  she couldn't do this 
T:	mm-hmm so she doesn't need me mmm just like a little much hmm he has more energy so do you usually spend time on the computer alone in your room or where's the computer in your house 
C:	I usually keep it in my room mm-hmm my bed with a cat hmm 
T:	so when your mama drugs you you said you have to pause the game when you get frustrated
C:	cuz I'm coming like  times in one out she knows she's seen 
T:	it all if you can imagine why your mom's doing that what do you think would be her reason for interrupting you so that hard way see but doesn't have to get up mmm because you have to tell me hmm I understand watching well it's frustrating yes well it sound like you care what your mom thinks 
C:	when she says my hair is next that hurts my feelings 
T:	mmm 
C:	because she's supposed to be MERIS follow us dogs news I am I have to say I need you here it's pretty fabulous too 
T:	yeah so your mom interrupts you when you're on the computer um and she ever taken your computer with you or tried to stop you from playing with appear 
C:	yes she has one time like I didn't need you I shouldn't screw you cuz she ain't on my gummy bears mmm that's a reason j omega versa which is something all of your moment no you get mad mmm my brain turned up you I wasn't in control mmm oh gosh possess me think that's it that's what happened and that happened and then I can use my computer my phone my kindle mmm nothing come in watch TV for three days no electrons for three days yeah night watching TV can you wash them as I didn't want to read all the books at around ten times how many new books so I literally had nothing to dip closer lost all my pencils like a drop 
T:	so how did it feel when you couldn't play with your xbox you couldn't play with your computer you couldn't look under candle you couldn't play with your phone you can watch TV it sounds like you were left without most of the things you enjoy the most yeah how does it feel 
C:	it felt like as much to explode or die at any moment and I asked if I have my electrons back mmm I've been a second day 
T:	mmm couldn't wait ain't no because when you have notebooks like all the books you have our books are very red don't want to read anymore because like you just think of the whole story three head all right just don't let the book in general you look like fences for drawing hi there's nothing to do you will explode mm-hmm do you have any ideas of things you could do or alternative ways to spend your time how did you handle that those three days without your computer 
C:	I did not handle the I have a pencil just as wasted my time I think she could draw since I have the hunger games series now but an earlier in the year I can read I can't read though stop going to bring back
T:	so you have three days without your electronics how are you able to do your homework 
C:	well um i think it was around left school hmm i don't think i have homework i think is on friday and then well it's difficult to find things to do
T:	well I've met quite a few children who have trouble finding alternative ways to spend their time besides electronics most of us are on our phones or on the computer or emailing each other I'm sure you have texting I'm sure you have a lot of homework you have to get done on the computer typing paper and only you can decide what interests you oh it's essential I used to come here mmm so it's necessary right if you want to be a game developer you feel like this is a learning experience for you to get used to play on computer so that you can actually bring it into your professional life later hmm there's your mom realizes
C:	I've said a billion zillion convoy like in front of everyone doesn't be getting it up and I go up I don't nothing baby younger i dead 
T:	mmm so you told her many many times yes attention was missing well she didn't work mmm sipping yeah so it sounds like you you feel like she's not listening to you she's always on her fault she could have no face bone why should people calling people up up mhm she have to go to schoo
C:	l said I was a dead bad days away
T:	oh thanks Emma told Anthony so when you get home from seven hours of school five days a week plus you like to chill with your computer that's your way relaxing it sounds like yes and also I heard you say that you see your mom on her phone all the time so eats the fact that she's playing on facebook and texting while she's telling you not to be on computer seems very hypocritical to you
C:	yes it makes me feel function 
T:	mmm you're angry yes so back to when you you had those three days about electronics you shared that you're reading books or you look back and you wish that you had had certain books during yes let's just say you had a chance to go back those three days and take fun things to do with you bit work relays your phone that weren't related to watching something on TV or netflix urn will get youtube or your kindle let's just imagine that we could go in time and take some fun ideas for things to do this in those three days in fact if you wouldn't mind I could share something with you that I've shared with other kids who have trouble thinking of things to do would you like to show you
