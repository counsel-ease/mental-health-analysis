T:	hi Sandra thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes I understand you don't have very much time but I really appreciate you stopping by
C:	well I came today because my daughter's in the hospital as well I think it's important to quit but I enjoy smoking I'm not ready to give it up right now my life is too much in turmoil
T:	so I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about but that overall coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter so can you tell me what was it that made it possible for you to even come in what were some of the things you were thinking about
C:	I think it's important because I I feel like I'm a bad role model for my children and my daughter's turning 12 and already some of her friends have tried smoking so I don't want her to think it's a good thing
T:	so the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking
C:	I smoked when I was young and I'd certainly don't want it for her
T:	and it sounds like you're smoking setting an example those are some things that that you're also a bit concerned about but as you said earlier not not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately
C:	well that's true it seems so hard I'm just not ready for this right now
T:	so Sandra what's good about smoking what do you like about it
C:	it's very enjoyable relaxing you know it's stress reliever when I'm at work we all go out and smoke and chitchat and you know talk about things I would hate to not smoke really I'd be left out
T:	what else tell me what else is good about it
C:	mmm I like to have a cigarette after I eat it sort of tells my brain I'm finished stop eating I'm full so it's it's a way to you know sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack so it's a way to control my weight
T:	okay so is there anything else that you like about it
C:	let me think well I just enjoy it I think it's it's not good for me I know but I'm so used to smoking I don't really think about quitting too much
T:	so let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking the things that you like about it and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out
C:	okay
T:	so it sounds like it's a way to relax it's a way to socialize with your friends from work and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke
C:	that's true yeah
T:	you also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight and concern that if you are we're going to quit smoking what that would do in terms of gaining weight and that smoking after meals is pleasurable that it's something that would be really hard to give up
C:	yeah
T:	I also heard that it's very much a part of your life it's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a nonsmoker does that capture for you some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking
C:	exactly mm-hmm
T:	so I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking what about the other side can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things
C:	well I I'm worried about my children I feel like I'm being a bad parent and I often wonder you know they've seen me smoke for years I certainly don't want my 12 year old daughter to start smoking and some of her friends are already smoking
T:	Sandra can you give me an example of a time that you did something that you think left an impression on your daughter or set a bad example for her
C:	yeah just this morning I was outside having a cigarette and when I looked up there she was looking out the window watching me smoke
T:	so this morning that experience it really brought home how she does watch you and she does really look up to you and notice what you do how did that feel when you looked up and saw her watching you
C:	I felt terrible you know I was projecting I want to be a good parent and I don't feel this really parted the plan
T:	and again thanks for your honesty in talking about this I appreciate that this is a this is a tough topic this is a hard behavior to think about giving up I guess one thing that one thing that doesn't make sense to me is that you know on the one hand you talk about how being a good parent is your highest priority it's really important to you to set a good example for your daughter
C:	mm-hmm
T:	and on the other hand I'm hearing you say that smoking is important in terms of stress relief socializing and it's something you can't imagine ever changing how do those two things fit together
C:	it doesn't fit you know it's the opposite side of the coin you know I'd love to do it but I don't think it's right
T:	so why would it take for quitting or changing your smoking to be something that was more important that raised it up in the list of priorities for you
C:	well I can't think of anything right now okay I don't have any plans to quit it's just something I'm thinking about
T:	so it's it's not so much that you don't want to quit in a way it's almost how could I do it that would work for me
C:	exactly
T:	okay I appreciate we we probably used up the time that we have I would love to see you next week if you'd be willing to schedule another appointment and talk with you more about this is that something that would be helpful
C:	oh sure sure I'll come in tomorrow
T:	not necessarily the most exciting thing for you to do but I appreciate you willing to do that can I also ask you to do a little bit of homework between now and next week I promise it's not too time-consuming we have a booklet that we like to give folks who are just thinking about changing who aren't sure that this is something that they're ready to do and one of the exercises is to write down your top three reasons for change why you would even consider quitting smoking and then to reflect on some of the good things as we talked about as well as some of the less good things about quitting and about continuing to smoke is that something you'd be willing to do over the next few days
C:	okay okay I'll give it a try
T:	okay here you go
C:	thank you
T:	so thanks for coming in Sandra we'll see you next week
C:	all right
