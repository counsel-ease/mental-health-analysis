T:	good morning Linda my name is Ann and I'll be your next to do yeah we have about 15 minutes where we could talk and I want you to know that whatever information you give me will be kept confidential and I'm only going to inform the health care team if needed yeah I actually am happy and respect the fact that you took of time off your busy schedule so come and see me today how are you feeling so what I think you are a little bit concerned right can you elaborate on that
C:	well unless you know I've been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and I was still a suspect I'm finding it hard to find the time to do that so it's really taking it totally it's not easy
T:	so what I'm hearing you say is it's really been hard it's really been difficult for you to exercise this data right yes
C:	that's true I actually tried a few plants earlier but it didn't work us blind soon it's not been easy for me to assess myself
T:	so what you're saying is you tried some strategies in the past but it didn't work out as planned this well I want you to know that relapse is normal and changing a behavior it's also quite as difficult it takes time so do not be too hard on himself but I appreciate the fact that you actually do try and that is a good step you did actually take so why do you want to change
C:	well I want to exercise because I've been told they will help me control my sugar level and my uncle died of diabetes and I don't want that to happen to me
T:	okay so on a scale of 0 to 10 there will be not important at all and 10 being very important how do you reach the level of importance of
C:	it's very important to me to exercise now so I'm sitting
T:	okay great that's wonderful so that tells me that it's actually very important to you right okay then on a scale of zero to ten again there being not that confident on not having any confidence in yourself and ten being very confident in yourself how would you reach your confidence level for changing to start to exercise so that's also good but can you explain to me why it's actually not informative
C:	well the fact that I've tried before makes it more than before even though I feel and being able to talk to somebody to gives me some confidence also
T:	okay okay so what do you think I've helped you move towards the -
C:	well I think I can come and see you for more advice and it will help me with my confidence
T:	well so Linda what I'm hearing you say is that it's actually very important for you to exercise but on the other hand you are not that confidence to actually start a success is that true
C:	that's very true
T:	okay well so far I don't know a few things about you can you tell me how it typically is like for you
C:	mmm I'm a businesswoman I'm very busy most of the time I have three stores in that and I drove quite a distance together I mean usually in the first off I ate and I moved through the other stores intermittently but I do take ways
T:	so what you're telling me is that on one hand you are very busy with your job but on the other hand you take place right and actually that's a good thing because we can actually capitalize upon taking your brakes have you ever thought of ways in which you could use your groups it's Eliza we've done
C:	a lot from eating I think I can go to there Jamie I actually thought of it luckily there's a gym by the second store so I plan to go there I work maybe every other day for now
T:	oh great that's really wonderful to hear from you can I share a few thoughts with you
C:	sure
T:	eyesight actually going to the gym or when you don't have the opportunity to go to the gym you can also use the stay keys instead of using the elevator
C:	oh my gosh
T:	yeah that would also provide a means of being physically active okay what do you think
C:	that sounds good I could actually park my car maybe some distance from the shop and network that sounds good
T:	okay so since I'm gonna see you back in two minutes in two weeks sorry I would like you to actually notes when you actually go to the gym and also when you use the staircase and bring it back write it down in your journal and would know the next step from there okay thank you
