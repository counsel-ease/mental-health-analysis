T:	well Terry I think I have a pretty good idea of what's going on with you you got some anxiety that's related to not having enough work to do in the economic stress that that's causing for you let me ask you about something else sometimes use of alcohol or drugs can contribute to anxiety I notice that you filled out one of our drug questionnaires could I take a look at that and maybe give you a little feedback? this one that's right yeah that's it okay and let me just clarify how much alcohol or drugs you might be using on average how many days a week or month would you have a drink that contains alcohol?
C:	oh no no alcohol use at all I don't drink at all alcoholism isn't my family so so is it something I just I choose to stay away from 
T:	okay so zero alcohol yeah no very good no risk related to that I know she did fill out our drug questionnaire though could you tell me in the past three months what what drugs you've used any street drugs or any prescription medications in a way that was not prescribed? 
C:	yeah while going to tell you I use marijuana pretty much every day uh-huh you know yeah so 
T:	on a typical day how many joints or blunts would you smoke?
C:	I'll I'll smoke on a typical day really to at least one or two joints a day 
T:	uh-huh okay yeah what's some of the good things about smoking marijuana? for you most people who smoke do it because they as does something good for them
C:	well for me it's been you know with the again with the stress of everything that's going on it's just that me time that I get to just sort of relax for me so all right let's get away yeah exactly exactly 
T:	so mm-hmm that's um what other good things about smoking marijuana for you? 
C:	well you know in college I've got a back injury from football and I will say that when I when I used to marijuana it does help relieve the pain 
T:	let's get some pain relief from it um what some of the not so good things for you about smoking marijuana?
C:	well it's funny you ask that I know that a few years ago it affected my my license for trucking they they did drug testing and who course I never used why was why was why was driving but it wasn't my system so I lost my license how long so that was big real big real big financially it's put a hit on everything so well ya know 
T:	what are the not so good things if any about smoking marijuana?
C:	well my my wife she tends to bring it up that it's a bad influence for the kids you know we we did use together when the kids came along she she stopped but I continued to use but I guess I forgot to use another issue that comes up it is between me and the wife that no using it has not been a good example for the kids
T:	stress or conflict there because I'm definitely that yeah so on the one hand it does give you some me time and an ability to kind of get away and relax and maybe manage your back pain a little bit better right on the other hand it's a it's had some big job consequences and in addition to that now scream friction in your relationship with your wife and as you physician I can tell you one of the medical consequences of smoking marijuana is that sometimes it actually increases anxiety sometimes just from the drug itself or sometimes as it's going out of your system you get a little withdrawal symptoms related to to the anxiety so you've got some good things some not-so-good things where does that leave you in terms of continuing to smoke to see them out or maybe cutting back or quitting?
C:	we will today you've given me a lot to think about I mean you know you know first a job and then of course my wife and did now I'm hearing it from you so you got me thinking is 
T:	information is kind of mounting for you 
C:	yeah it is it is
T:	well let me ask you on a scale of zero to ten zero would be not ready to make any change or ten would be on I'm really ready to make a significant change today where would you put yourself in terms of being ready to cut back or I'll quit your marijuana use?
C:	hmm that's a good skill zero to ten they I'm gonna say five 
T:	mm-hmm right in the middle 
C:	yeah just just because of yeah that's 
T:	why I want five and not a three or a two?
C:	well wouldn't put it as low as three or two because I just like I share it with you just you know with my job and that I lost lost my license with it being an issue that comes up between me and my wife and then now today it's hot you know I I would say that's probably reason why I got it out of five because you I don't know 
T:	yeah so you've got some things that are really making you think about it yeah well let me tell you what I thought we might do with your anxiety today I thought we might start you on a medication that's very safe non addicting I try probably some sertraline medicine that you take every day and slowly it's not going to take away your anxiety immediately but will slowly bring down the anxiety level in your life and then we also could engage in some counseling if you're interested somebody who could help you learn to deal with stress think through the issue of what to do about your marijuana use and also do some marital counseling between your wife if you lie what do you thoughts about?
C:	that okay well on the cow side let me let me check let me check with my wife first okay CFS something she wants to wants to do uh hmm yeah don't think about that no 
T:	I will take it and think about it and if you decide you want to do that just give a call back here to the office we can set that up
C:	okay all right 
T:	what about a next step for you in terms of your marijuana use what would you like to do about that?
C:	well based on you and based on what I've been here and I guess I need to go ahead and try and cut back a little bit you know baby I can just tried tried going how long ain't gonna make no promises maybe just say maybe three three days a week rather than the rule I can try to do that just cut back into weekends or something yeah yeah like that let me just sort of think through
T:	well Terry I think that's a good plan I'll write your prescription you can pick that up at the desk on the way out start taking your medication if you and your wife decide you want to go for with the counseling just call back to the office here and we'll set that up I will see you in three to four weeks and I have a handout for you that I'd like to give you it has a lot of medical facts about marijuana we find a lot of people are not familiar with all of the different medical and mental health complications you can get from marijuana but it's something we'll give you a little bit more information to think about 
C:	okay all right I appreciate this and Wow I'll take a look at it 
T:	okay very good and I'll plan to see you back in three to four weeks
C:	all right thank you doctor
