T:	well I'm here for my cleaning what I'm also having a lot of trouble flossing because of my braces I can't get the laws under my wire and I've just found that it's just been way too hard so I just stopped doing it 
T:	okay well let me ask you a question and you can just explain it to the best of your ability but what do you think clogging is? how do you think it affects your teeth? 
C:	well what clogging is it's a white substance that gets built up around your teeth and it can go to your gums and make your gums like red and inflamed 
T:	okay yes not only is the redness and the inflammation a problem but if you continue to let it get worse and worse you can actually deteriorate your bone routine now that you know more about black do you think stop flossing?
C:	no but it's just way too hard well
T:	there's a lot of things in life that are hard but we all have to do them so I can give you some flossing it's that i recommend everything so basically just going to your lot more Walgreens or any and ask the person in the store to point you towards the right direction and basically you're looking for a class in hey and what you're going to do is we're going to take the floss and you're going to straight end and go in between your and then Glaus each individual tooth like that 
C:	Wow but that still sounds like a lot of work 
T:	well you need to do it and you need at least try to do it because you don't your teeth when you could have just prevented it by doing it for a few much today 
C:	okay I will 
T:	so I really want to see some improvement at our next appointment with the flossing technique that I have recommended for you and we'll see how you do next time 
C:	okay
