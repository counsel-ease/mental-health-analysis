T:	rainy Beckett I'm a nurse practitioner
C:	hi nice to meet you 
T:	nice to meet you. tell me uh what brings you in today 
C:	have a sore throat and a cough okay and I really wanted to get some antibiotics
T:	okay so you have a sore throat and a cough 
C:	yes okay 
T:	and when did this start?
C:	this morning this morning 
T:	yes so it just started today then 
C:	yes I'm trying to cut it off at the past because if I just can't afford to be sick 
T:	okay so tell me a scale of zero to ten where zero is no pain at all on ten is like take me to the emergency room where would you say the pain is?
C:	uh I would say it's about a six so 
T:	it's any pain 
C:	yeah yeah it's pretty painful
T:	so you said you needed antibiotics 
C:	yes yes there's a friend that I work with says that she tried antibiotics before it it stopped within the like two days so okay that's one that's what I want to do so you can just write me in prescription that'd be great
T:	okay well I'll tell you what why don't I uh examine you first and let's see what that okay shows up and then we'll decide what we're going to do 
C:	okay
T:	all right so sandy we did an exam and you do have some redness in the back of  your throat but there's no pus or white stuff or anything back there and your ears look okay and your eyes look okay you don't have this to hurt just a little bit right I understand and you have you don't have any swollen nodes or lymph nodes or glands in your neck or anything and your lungs sound clear and your heart sounds great okay so this is probably a virus and for a virus you don't need antibiotics 
C:	oh so what are you trying to say you're not gonna give me antibiotics 
T:	uh no because you don't need them and now a friend where I work
C:	I work at CVS okay and she says that she took antibiotics when she had a sore throat and it was gone within like two days and so that that's why I'm here 
T:	okay so you work at CVS 
C:	yes 
T:	in the pharmacy?
C:	uh no in the photo department 
T:	oh okay 
C:	and my friends a cashier okay but she knows you know we work at CVS 
T:	okay all right well I'll tell you with a virus a virus the antibiotics don't do any good so I just suggest you take some ibuprofen like  milligrams every  to  hours for the pain and then gargle with some salt water and a tablespoon of honey and some hot tea will help but this will probably just go away in  or  days and you don't need any antibiotics 
C:	so you're telling me you're not gonna give me antibiotics and I just paid a $ copay to come see you 
T:	well if you don't need them then you know part of my job is to tell you what's best for you so 
C:	no you I'm not gonna read your prescription for any so then I'm just got to go see another doctor 
T:	well I'm sorry but that's you know that's your option I'll just send you the bill so sandy we did yours
