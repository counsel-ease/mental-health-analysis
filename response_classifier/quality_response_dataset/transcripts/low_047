T:	okay so why don't you have a rinse David. how are you feeling 
C:	okay 
T:	good here take a look see what you think that feeling and the colors okay? you know there is quite a lot of stainings so I'm just wondering about um some concerns about smoking possibly gonna get that a coffee tea yeah have you heard this before yeah mm-hmm so you know the smoking is going to be related not just to some of the other negative consequences you know physically it infects dental caries dental cavities
C:	yeah
T:	um healing yeah in your mouth okay
C:	sure so I heard it all I but I just want to get my teeth fixed 
T:	yes and I really want to be helpful I really want to you know my commitment is to your oral health so there are lots of medications out there David that actually take away a lot of the cravings there they make winning song to my old things 
C:	I did try it so like I did try it i just did the pills and they didn't work yeah it was a waste and a cause more side effects 
T:	know it but David it's not a waste research hows that people take on average about seven tries before they quit smoking so think of it as you're one step closer to quitting 
C:	or seven lectures along the road 
T:	well I don't think I'm giving you a lecture it's really not what I meant I know 
C:	I just feel that way I get really I get very defensive about when the brick because I get it from my family doc my cardiologist everybody is like I'm not a complete fool I am for smoking 
T:	well there's there's a reason that other people are talking to quit no but as I said these medications so you've tried the medication you've been willing once then can I write you a prescription for the medication can we talk about how you could use it? because this is something that that's very important not just for your overall physical ha guess 
C:	I got to really want to it things I've tried usually caused me more problems and they helped
T:	oh no the smoking is going to cause you more problems than the than anything else I can promise you that David the side effects from the medications are nothing compared to what can happen from the smoking like that's the I think thing to really consider 
C:	okay low can I go now?
T:	I'm okay but you 
C:	know i know it i know'd I know doc what you're trying to do with it I I just don't want to get into that right now 
T:	okay well thanks for listening and honestly I I am really worried about the smoking so okay
C:	Iappreciate your care 
T:	I'm here to help
