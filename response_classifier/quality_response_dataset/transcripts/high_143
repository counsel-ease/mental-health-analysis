T:	you leap in so far I'm still a little bit anxious 
T:	yes last week when you were and you were telling me that you were experiencing great anxiety and we had developed a plan a plan for your anxiety and according to my notes you were going to look into some yoga classes you were going to attempt to drink less coffee you were going to get out more with people because you were kind of isolating yourself in the home and you were going to spend more time in nature so I'm wondering how all that went 
C:	well I looked at the gym and there weren't really any yoga classes so I didn't I didn't really do that I did cut back on my coffee a little bit but I just find that it wakes me up in the morning so you know I've cut back to one cup instead of two cups and I did take the dog for a walk but I haven't really gotten out other than that 
T:	okay so it sounds like you've made some movement forward towards your goals you did at least look into yoga even though the gym didn't have yoga classes you did cut down from two cups of coffee to one and you did get out with your dog in nature for a walk but it sounds like you had a little bit of an issue getting out more with people 
C:	yeah I don't I don't really like to go out with people there's usually a lot a lot of chatter a lot of talking and it's hard for me to be in there 
T:	so it's uncomfortable for you to be out around people with all the speaking and chatting and talking and how does that make feel 
C:	um it just makes me feel a little bit nervous and then when I get out there don't really I don't really engage in conversation 
T:	okay so actually getting out with people actually makes you even more anxious so I'm wondering what we could do about that 
C:	um I'm not really sure maybe I could invite people over instead 
T:	that would absolutely be one option you could invite people over to your house and then you could get to choose who you're around 
C:	yeah it's a good idea 
T:	and in terms of the the yoga let's get back to the yoga format tell me more about where you looked for yoga classes 
C:	well I just looked at my gym I didn't really look anywhere else because I'm already paying to go to a gym and I don't really want to pay extra to go somewhere else so that's why I didn't really look anywhere else 
T:	mm-hmm and so if I were to ask you right now how motivated are you to find a yoga class on a scale of one to ten 
C:	maybe about a five or six 
T:	okay and so what made you say five or six rather than two or three
C:	um well I I see all these pictures in my newsfeed about yoga and I see all these pictures and I just want to do it so I'm interested in doing it it's just really hard
T:	so when you see the pictures on your newsfeed it makes you excited about doing it but when you actually go to do it it makes it yeah more challenging
C:	well it's it I haven't done it before so it's a little bit hard to get out there because I don't think I'm as flexible as the other people 
T:	mm-hmm and so you're thinking that you're not as flexible as the other people I'm wondering if that's what yoga is about civility 
C:	well I think I think that people go to become flexible but I think that maybe some people are already just flexible 
T:	mm-hmm so you are concerned that maybe you might not be as flexible as the rest yeah and you'd be a beginner
C:	well I'm worried I wouldn't be able to do the poses in class
T:	okay so what do you think would happen if you couldn't do the poses in class
C:	well I I feel embarrassed I think and then if the teacher tried to get me to do it and everybody else would see that they're trying to get me into a pose and I think it would be embarrassing 
T:	okay so you'd be embarrassed if you couldn't do the certain poses and how would you feel if you could do all the poses in the class
C:	well I think I feel really good 
T:	and so what do you think it is preventing you from not doing all the poses in the class 
C:	why I guess it's just the embarrassment of maybe not being able to do it 
T:	what what would cause you to not be able to do it with the closest or not
C:	I'm not sure 
T:	okay I remember when you first came in last week you told me that when you were younger you used to be very very flexible and I'm wondering what would make that difference between then and now
C:	well when I was a kid I used to just practice a stretch a lot and now that I don't I don't have that same flexibility
T:	mm-hmm 
C:	so as I've gotten older I've lost a lot of flexibility 
T:	and how would it be if you couldn't do all the poses in the class and you did get embarrassed and you just let it be embarrassed 
C:	I mean it would be okay but I don't I don't like that feeling what would be the payoff 
T:	do you think if you put up with a little bit of embarrassment 
C:	well I probably feel we're not a good in the end 
T:	you know I can give you a lots of studies that I can give you and videos that I can show you of people that started yoga and started practicing yoga and their anxiety went way down as a matter of fact some studies show that anxiety doing yoga can be decreased the same as medications so I'm not sure if you were if you knew that or not 
C:	I didn't really know that I just thought that that yoga was more about flexibility I didn't realize there were so many other benefits 
T:	okay so how motivated would that make you feel on a scale of one to ten
C:	well I probably if I thought that I'd be it would make me less anxious I think I'd probably be around an eight or nine 
T:	good good that's a definite improvement and and you could determine after that first class whether you're levels have decreased or not and that would that be validation for you or would that be you give you even more motivation if your anxiety levels were decreased instantly after the yoga class
C:	I think that would be a lot of motivation
T:	okay to continue so one other thing that I wanted to to mention to you um was you said that you'd walk your dog in nature and I'm curious as to how much time did you spend walking your dog in nature 
C:	wow it was only about  minutes it was really cold and windy so we didn't want to stay out and by we I mean the dog and I
T:	mmm-hmm and so because of it was cold and Wendy you decided to kind of cut the walk short 
C:	yeah
T:	and and that's definitely understandable I'm wondering what you could do to possibly get an hour of walking the dog in a day 
C:	Wow it might help if I take a jacket next time 
T:	okay so if you took a check in case it's gold 
C:	yeah 
T:	and do you have a special place in nature that makes you feel peaceful that you could be and that would help you even more enjoy it 
C:	as long as I'm just away from road noise and traffic and then it's a lot better 
T:	okay 
C:	and there's lots of trails around my house like that 
T:	okay excellent it's great that you have trails around your house where you're not exposed to all that noise and so do you think you could commit to an hour probably and on a scale of one to ten tell me what that probably means 
C:	um it's probably a ten I can I can to that 
T:	okay all right so it sounds like last week you had a few problems carrying out play assignments towards decreasing your anxiety you really couldn't find a yoga class because you're already signed up for a gym that doesn't have the yoga classes but you you already know about the yoga videos that I've sent you so you could actually do them at home how strongly do you feel about doing them at home
C:	if I could do them at home I would probably do them all the time 
T:	mm-hmm I think that would be a big difference and then there would be no embarrassment factor if you couldn't do the poses less coffee you've gone from two cups to one cup that's very good and get out more with people you've decided to invite people over to your house rather than going out with other people not knowing who's going to be in your space that's always an apprehensive moment when you don't know you have no control over who's going to be in your space and on a scale of one to ten you think that you could spend at least an hour a day walking with the dog job I think we have a plan so overall on all four of these items how motivated do you feel on a scale of one to ten 
C:	I think it's a  I think I can do them on all four all four
T:	fabulous and how do you think you will feel if you were to envision how you would feel incorporating all of these items in your life next week of the course of next week how much of a difference do you think it would make you feel
C:	I think it but maybe even make me look forward to doing these if I were doing them on a regular basis
T:	mm-hmm and how would it make you feel 
C:	I think it would make me feel really good
T:	and so you feel relaxed and you would feel more positive and I think you would - very good 
C:	thank you
T:	we'll check in next week we'll make an appointment for next week and catch up and see how you're doing with all this good job 
C:	thank you so much
