T:	how have you been?
C:	I've been great thank you how about you?
T:	good thanks for asking today we're going to start by just asking a few questions I was just  wondering how your home care has been  since the last time I saw you know? so  what type of products are you using to  clean your teeth and to help prevent the  build-up of plaque and bacteria and  stuff?
C:	well I've been using the manual  toothbrush that you gave me in my last  visit six months ago and then I've lost  when I think about it probably only once  a month and whatever i buy toothpaste I  normally just get what's on sale to  store 
T:	okay well that wasn't what I was  expecting here and I'm pretty  disappointed in your home care habits  that's not the proper way to care for  your teeth Oh as a professional and your  hygienist I need you to buy an electric  toothbrush because they remove way more  than your manual one I also need you to  brush twice a day and floss once a day  and use some type of toothpaste of  fluoride in it and lastly I really need  you to use a mouthwash to prevent the  build-up of bacteria and help print out  everything out of your mouth after  brushing and flossing 
C:	wow that's kind of  a lot for me to do all in one try I have  a really hard time with mouthwash  especially because it really burns my  mouth and I end up having to spit it out  really quickly because it just hurts me  too bad and I have to drink a lot of  water after to get the burning sensation  in my mouth 
T:	well I know what I'm talking  about i went to school for two years to  get my degree and what I'm telling you  is really important if you want to try  to keep all of your teeth and not get  gingivitis or periodontal disease do you  not care about your health? 
C:	I do but like I said it just burns my mouth so badly  use mouthwash 
T:	you only have to swish for   seconds and then go  minutes  without food or water if you can't  handle that it's pretty embarrassing as  an adult here's my favorite it's  Listerine cool mint let me see you swish  for  seconds that way I know that you  know what to do with the product when  you get home and you can just keep that  to spit out whenever I tell you that the  time is up  is it burning? mm-hmm keep going almost  there okay you can go ahead and spit it  out into the cup thank you so is it bad?
C:	yeah it really burned so can I have some  water my mouth is really burning?
T:	well you have to go  minutes without it so  it'll go by fast okay and then i'm going  to give you this little mini bottle that  you can take home with you until you go  to the store to buy your own just make  sure it's this one cuz that one's really  going to clean your mouth the best even  though it burns a little bit okay just  remember it's the best for your help and  if you don't want to lose your teeth  then you're going to need to do that
C:	thanks
