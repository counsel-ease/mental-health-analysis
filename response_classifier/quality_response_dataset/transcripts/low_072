T:	So what did the doctor tell you about this medication?
C:	Actually he told me it might stop my son’s growth, my son really wants to be an athlete, so I’m just really concerned that it might affect his growth in some way. 
T:	Okay so I wouldn’t worry about that. If you want him to be an athlete, it’s probably more important to worry about him breathing clearly than it is to worry about his height.
