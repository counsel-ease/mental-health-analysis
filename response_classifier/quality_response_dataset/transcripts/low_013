T:	I can see it's after my dad you today
C:	well I've got myself all worked up now I've been sat outside only I'm not I'm now late I'm sorry and I'm going to see you because I've got a really sore throat it's been like this for a good few days antibiotics
T:	all right then okay well let's let's just have a look shall we see what's going on you just fine open your mouth for me so ah
C:	ah
T:	okay right see if your honesty I'm looking there it just looks like one of those viruses that going around at the moment that are causing these sore throats so I think that we should just go for a bit of paracetamol and some fluids and snail it nature sort it out
C:	I've been saying for half an hour do you not want to know a little bit more about to so I mean it's really painful I've barely been able to swallow today and I'm still worried about passing things on to the kids and
T:	well I mean I'm sorry we're a bit late but you know that's general practice isn't it you know sometimes these things happen but there's also the fact that you do just have a virus and they are very common and the nice thing is that it will get better with paracetamol and fluids and the process will help with giving it to the kids I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about that it's unlikely they'll get it but I'm going to it
C:	well I mean it's going to affect my job I talked on the phone quite a lot of work and I'm just I don't think at the moment I'm going to be able to go to work and can I at least get a sick note
T:	all right well well not really you need to self-certifying you for seven days off six it's going to take some time off just take some paracetamol lots of fluids get a self-certified note and it in to your employer and put sauce right there
C:	I don't think my employee are going to take that I mean that they've given us so much has some things in the past Anika can I get a private no can I ask you to write me a letter at least
T:	oh well obviously that's a non NHS thing so we have to charge you for that going rate that is 12 pounds
C:	it's just not good enough I just I'm sorry but you know if you have just got a sore throat and there's not much I can do about that it's just you know something that we all get from time to time perhaps what you really need to do is you know just take some paracetamol and get some fluids
T:	how does the paracetamol do you understand how difficult this is going to be for me I mean I could lose my job or something okay
C:	that's pretty good like the software I think that's so yeah a little bit of grunt staging though I'm sorry I think I'm gonna say something that I don't I don't want to so much to go to go
T:	okay
C:	thank you
