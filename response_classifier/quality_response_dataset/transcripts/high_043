C:	then go ahead and have a seat right here
T:	all right perfect
C:	you have all kinds of fun stuff for us today right I didn't change my ways
T:	are you ready for that
C:	I am ready all right very excited
T:	good well I am too and it's a pleasure to be here thank you for trusting me I've got the questionnaire that you filled out earlier for us and I brought that with me today
C:	okay
T:	I made a few notes for myself and I want to go through and ask you some additional questions but before I get the questionnaire out for us to begin talking let me tell you a little bit about today and that today is about you I'm gonna be asking you quite
C:	well I never hear that very often
T:	I thought you might enjoy that
C:	all right
T:	so I'm gonna be asking you some in-depth questions and some of them you may have questions about why I'm asking the questions and you're perfectly okay to to ask me about that if that comes up for you I'm I can answer your questions as well but what I'm gonna be doing is asking you things about in detail about what kinds of things you eat and also other lifestyle things and that will help me put together a program for you moving ahead so thank you for the advance work that you did and thanks for your patience as I get the bag out here
C:	I'm anxious to see I analyzed all of that
T:	well you know something you're um you are really already pretty far ahead in the in the continuum of things now that this is something that we should be judging it's not like there's a good way or a bad way and one of the things I say to my clients is this if we look at the way that we eat and we live our lifestyles as a continuum with one end of the spectrum being the standard American diet and people who we know are doing some unhealthy things and then at the other end of the spectrum you've got the really really really healthy people that you don't ever want to be around because they make you feel guilty for everything you do and every choice that you make yes we all do and if you can find a spot for you on that continuum that fits for you at any particular given period of time that's what it is that we're trying to do here and it's not a judging thing it's not that you're trying to get from one fit place together and and remember this also Michelle as we work together there will be points in time when you will feel like you're on top of the world and you're doing good job and something may happen for you that causes you to have a little bit of a setback maybe stress at work maybe something happens in your personal life whatever or maybe it's the holidays and you're celebrating and you might have what you would call quote a setback it's not the end of the world and we'll talk as we go along about how to address those types of issues how to deal with those how to head them off at the pass so this is an ongoing continuum kinds of thing and remember it's a lifestyle this isn't a diet and so
C:	right absolutely
T:	that's where we're going with this so
C:	that's why that's why I like you and your approach and I think it's gonna be a nice fit for where I'm trying to get in my family and so let's do it
T:	absolutely the first couple of questions that I asked had to do with what what it was you consumed and I asked whether or not you ate meat chicken fish and so forth you're not vegetarian according to this and so you do eat some of those things talk to me a little bit about the sources of the food that you get the meat product
C:	the sources I tried to buy you know is organic as possible that's not always the case you know sometimes we buy it in bulk we try to access the farmers that are in this area
T:	ok
C:	have it available and for me personally I've you know meat isn't a focus of when I'm putting a meal together but my husband you know is a meat eater and so I try to incorporate it into things more for for his you know satisfaction than anything and you know it's not we don't need a lot of it but it is part of our Cherno part of our diet
T:	ok and I'll I'm gonna hit the pause button for you and tell you you know that I am personally and vegan and I'm a raw foodist
C:	right
T:	when I ask you these questions again it's not from a judging perspective it's not because I'm gonna say to you well we're gonna cut meat out of your diet in a hurry that's not the case at all what I'm asking the reason I'm asking is so that when I build things for you and build a program for you I'm accommodating the things that you're comfortable with if there are things that I ask you for example if you say I do eat meat now I don't want to and then we'll talk about that so that's where that question is coming from so I'm delighted to hear that you're conscious about the sources of your meat products or get
C:	perfect with it by any means sometimes it's what's available or I'm in a hurry or we're having people you know and but I do try to yeah get it
T:	organic and local that's
C:	it natural yeah it's possible
T:	that's wonderful and then obviously you're aware of hormones and antibodies and those kind or antibiotics and those
C:	right
T:	we can let's leave that out yeah and the same thing with dairy products you've got some dairy products on your repertoire talk about that
C:	heavily I'm not a milk drinker but I do like cheese
T:	mm-hmm
C:	and so and I cook with milk you know of course but I'm not I haven't drank milk since I was little
T:	okay
C:	but I do like cheese and probably eat a lot of cheese and eggs and that but um you know I and like I said it would same with the meat I don't know that I want to do away with any of it but I just want to kind of what naturally evolves and happens with I just want to you know be smarter about how we prepare things and where we're getting it from then
T:	right
C:	how we're putting it together
T:	do you ever have any ill effects from the dairy that you can sue
C:	no
T:	okay so you don't have a digestion issue
C:	I know I I'm pretty I I don't really have any ill effects from anything that I eat very very rarely
T:	and the rest of the family is okay with that too okay good so when I'm asking the questions I'm primarily asking about you but if it if it comes up that somebody in your family if I hit a hot button and you say oh I don't have sinus problems but my my offspring do or my feelings do or whatever then let's talk about that as well um you have you have a husband
C:	yes I do and the daughter this turns 8 this month
T:	Wow okay and no ill problem no health problems
C:	no
T:	okay
C:	not with any of us
