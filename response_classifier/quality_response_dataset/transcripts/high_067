T:	hi Dina
C:	hi
T:	I'm hailing the dietitian how are you
C:	here real
T:	good how you doing today
C:	how are you
T:	do you want to speak to me?
C:	just not diagnosed with these I'm really confused and concerned so the doctor said that I should come see you some help
T:	yeah absolutely um do you know what type
C:	1 diabetes
T:	so basically what type 1 diabetes is it's a condition where our body stops production on the hormone called insulin and what influences for our body is it helps to convert food which is converted to sugar into energy for ourselves so let me show you an example let's say that this is ourselves and this is glucose so what food breaks down now our cells will need you to glucose as of energy but glucose can't get into it so it's insulin acts as a hormone open up your cells the cause of the glucose and that is how it's used for energy and this energy is what we use in everyday life like thinking talking moving things like that so without insulin your body isn't able to get the glucose into ourselves so this caused us a lot of problems so with that we have conditions like hyper let's eat yet which is what we have too much glucose in the body and that's off hypoglycemia which is what we have not and this is kind of the bounce we could try to face when it comes to type 1 diabetes so it's really important to monitor and make sure that we keep the blood glucose levels or sugar intact so do you have any questions so far?
C:	no no
T:	okay great so did your doctor talk to you anything about insulin or taking insulin
C:	he prescribed me for what he sounds a fast-acting insulin and that I should take it before you
T:	okay so today we're actually going to talk about different ways that you can meet and how we can work with your diet and foods would eat with the insulin you're gonna take it so we're gonna talk about carbohydrate counting which I'll explain in a second we're also gonna talk about portion sizes come we're also gonna talk about timing and his estate meals especially when it comes to taking insulin so before we start I asked you did you forget any food items in today
C:	I brought some macaroni cheese delicious
T:	okay awesome so when it comes to carbohydrate crowning we always want to make sure that we're aware of the carpod so if you know what a carbohydrate is
C:	the star chips my prey like bread rice pasta
T:	absolutely so do like
C:	yeah
T:	okay great so when it comes to carbohydrates there's also different types of carbohydrates in foods like ice cream or milk or some of our vegetables actually contain carbohydrates just sometimes not so much but they still contain a little bit some carbohydrates so let's look at this so when it comes to looking at nutrition labels we want to make sure that we're counting the total amount of carbohydrates per serving so when we account for carb exchange we like to think of 15 grams of carbohydrate equals one carb exchange and we want to make sure especially we type 1 diabetes that were laundering that especially with the influent we're taking so when it comes to 15 grams per one exchange how many carbons changes do you think are in one serving of the second cheese
C:	okay serving 47 grams
T:	yeah that's great that's awesome um that's exactly right and it's also good that you've rounded an off so you know kind of exact or estimates of how many cars you do so it's really good to be aware of that now is there any other foods that you brought in today
C:	yeah in my morning cereal
T:	I'm seeing great great so based off the serving size of one cup how many karbix changes do you see
C:	okay so there's 42
T:	yeah absolutely so that's great so making sure that you're aware of that it's awesome and it's really beneficial especially we know where again how many so great I also looked at your 24-hour recall and I wrote down some items that you ate during dinner and this was the nutrition facts for them and one of them is the avocado chicken salad from Panera and the pizza field corazon you had so based on the nutrition label how many total carbs that they have for each one
C:	okay there is 7 grams carbohydrate in avocado chicken salad and 15 grams of carbohydrates in the real one
T:	okay great that's awesome um when it comes to the avocado chicken salad there tends to be a low amount of carbohydrates because of the vegetables but also being aware that chicken and fat don't contain any carbohydrates so it's really important for the constitute exchanges that you're aware of kind of how fat doesn't have any carbs but to gain consideration why do you think the veal parmesan has 15 grams of carbohydrate yeah that's that's awesome you made the distinction so yeah I'm just making sure when you check your salads or you're checking your meat that there's no there is if they're just start to comes out as a card exchange or you kind of do it so that's great do any questions okay great so going forward I wanna ask you a little bit about portion sizes so when it comes to portion sizes this goes hand-in-hand with carbohydrate counting does you want to know how many portion sizes you have to avoid if you're overeating or knowing coming cartilage so going with that we like to do a hand method which is about one fistful is about one cup of vegetables or rice or pasta and this is a good measurement of kind of how many carbs are so for example if you have one cup of pasta that would be three cartridges because 1/3 of a cup of pasta is what carb exchange so just being aware of that same with rice and also with vegetables it's great because 1/2 a cup is only eventual exchange but there's very little carbohydrates so you all have to really worry about how much I'm one cup of script so using the hand method is a really great way of pushing out so I wanted to ask you face off of the cereal how many this amount of cereal
C:	so I'm gonna make my fist looked a little bigger than my fist so I take about a cup and a half so since one cup is three carbs exchanges
T:	yeah
C:	it would probably be a little bit more than three exchanges
T:	great great that's awesome so that's a really good method you can use we also like to use again with the hand method something that you can look at is three ounces of a meat or chicken is about the size of your palm and for fat from the top of your thumb to the bottom of it is about one tablespoon so that can be considered of that exchange as well so we can go look at that so great I'm so glad that so going off of that when it comes to consume meals and timing of meals it's really important when especially when you're taking fast acting insulin because what happens is when you take insulin you're supposed to be eating 15 minutes before after you take your insulin so it to make sure that works and that you don't go into a state of hyper will say I see though cuz you're not eating any good though so it doesn't so it's really important to so I want to ask you because I know you have a really really busy day because you are working at the shop that you say yeah we work that and that normally you don't have time for breaks and stuff like that so I want to ask you what time of the day you can would be a good way to add meals or snacks to your everyday schedule
C:	well I don't really eat so maybe in between breakfast and lunch and lunch and dinner preferably Porsche
T:	great great because that's actually a great record bomb great suggestion because it's really important especially because you want to make sure that your glucose cells are intact that you're eating less than four hours in between meals so a lot of times people tend to eat either three big meals or they tend to eat six small meals so whatever you want you choose that go as well with your work schedule totally up to you just making sure that you're monitoring it and making sure you're taking it with your insulin before time so going with that I wanted to ask you at four o'clock so what kind of needles are doing at that time because that's really
C:	well that's right before I go in to teach my class so nothing too big maybe just like banana
T:	okay um it's not a realistic goal for you do you think you will have trying to eat that's not during that period of time
C:	yeah just something smaller
T:	okay absolutely so when it comes to bananas this is specially really important roots are also considered a carbohydrate exchange about 1/2 a cup and we time to think of a banana one full exchange so just letting you know that a half a cup which is about a half a banana it's one carbon straight so if you're eating one full banana it's considered to carb exchanges but throughout this whole process you'll learn a lot about different kinds of exchanges and how to tell which one some people get really really good at it so and if you have any questions you go that way so going on is there any other areas of improvement you would like to do for snacking or anything like that
C:	I feel like I just need to get in a routine and start snacking more so I can keep consistent
T:	okay so where's another time of day where you would like to add back
C:	well I do have a light breakfast and then I don't eat till lunch so probably in between there
T:	okay what time we thinking about
C:	10:00
T:	okay and what kind of sweets do you like to eat during that time or like in the morning
C:	in the mornings I can't really do anything too sweet so maybe some vegetables
T:	vegetables what kind of apples do you like
C:	like carrots celery I love cucumbers
T:	okay so would you like to have what kind of snacks would you like two halves would you like I like to have a little vegetables or what are you looking for when it comes ideally
C:	yeah well I need something fast and on the go because I'm always moving I'm always going around I don't really have time to sit and settle and eat
T:	okay
C:	so I need stuff that packages easily that I can just take with me
T:	okay
C:	so there's actually I don't know if you heard but we have these I grocery stores sometimes they have these great snack packs so sometimes they come with like a little bit of hummus and vegetables do you like oh well it's something you can definitely try or what do you think of like peeler perfect so peanut butter no vegetables I'll be great for the morning so that's great they made that connection that's awesome these are really great changes and we definitely I'm really excited to work with this with you so that's not the time we have today but before we leave I have these handouts for you so this is another alternative method instead of the hand method but it's a really great way of planning so that half your plate being notables 1/4 being starch and another fourth being meats and there's also a method we talked about the portion sizes and a little meals to calm pattern and before you leave I also want to ask you what did you learn today
C:	so I learned a lot of carb exchanges and to really watch those method which is one cup one meat portion and your Samus fat okay and then also just about really spreading out my food and working to eat more consistently
T:	okay and I have a quick quiz for you what does fifteen grams of carbohydrates equal
C:	oneexchange
T:	perfect and what is one banana equal to
C:	go to exchanges
T:	correct that's awesome I'm really excited to work with you but I also have this great information about type one diabetes so it will tell you about different kinds of carbohydrates are considered like breads what we're talking about that milk fruit and sweets also why it's important and also there's a little list over here which is a food journal that you can use so for the next few days or the next month I would really like for you to see what kind of changes you're making and what kind of goals you would like to set to move forward especially when it comes to your meals so just write them down and I plan to meet with you in about a month so we can talk about your
