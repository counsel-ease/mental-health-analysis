T:	how are you 
C:	I'm good thanks for asking 
T:	I understand you come here today today's antsy because you had a recent arrest
C:	yeah I got a DUI for being under the influence of alcohol marijuana 
T:	how come on marijuana how recently was this do you like about we could uh okay so what's been going on what happens
C:	um well I am gonna have to go to course there and I know that are probably going to have to get some type of like treatment or something like that but I really just don't want to so are just I'm just coming here because I know maybe I can like get out of it from getting some type of treatment but oh yeah get out of it
T:	you mean get a discharge?
C:	yeah I mean I feel like they're probably going to make me like go to rehab or something like that I'll want to do that 
T:	so you feel like you can get out of the rehab are too 
C:	um I don't know I really am not sure i just know that I don't know getting in getting the DUI is kind of just made me realize I like me to make a change in terms not ready to stop drinking or using marijuana there's just like the only things that like really help me in my life 
T:	alright so with this recent arrest we realize it may be value to stop using the joy don't want to 
C:	mmhmm yeah 
T:	so you're stuck there 
C:	yeah kind of like I was like realize that like drinking into you marijuana hasn't like got me anywhere positive really but it's like the only thing that like I know it just that's all I do usually employed an exam or like
T:	feel better when you drink you ever socialize at the same time
C:	I mean sometimes I'll like go to bars and things like that but most times just like that I have alone city of the marijuana yeah I mean I'd like a few people that always smoke with but usually just kind of like by myself I'm a smoke everyday 
T:	so thought it was what people are doing it so does it sound like you're really worried about losing your social support if you stop using not really so what are you losing 
C:	I kind of just like to use it to like cope i got like i have a brain injury that i got like a while ago and like it still causes pain and that's just the only thing that ever seems to help once after an injury this is alcohol marijuana 
T:	so you take it for pain relief equalities 
C:	yeah
T:	any other reasons? 
C:	um it's just easier it's just the marijuana leaf relaxes me it's just easier to kind of like forget about things when i'm using forget about problems yeah 
T:	so it affects your mood in a positive way 
C:	yeah like I get like I'd like the feeling once i'm drunk and then if i'm feeling like anxious or anything like that like the marijuana helps with that so then it's easier to like I don't feel anything so I'll have to worry I don't have to deal with any negative feelings 
T:	have you used since you had to do you 
C:	I um I haven't drank but I looked like I cut back on my smoking a little bit but i'm still using alright in a bit of a situation 
T:	alright so you have the use that takes away pain for you 
C:	it takes my anxiety feels good but then you have these consequences of the law yeah how do you figure those two things out I don't know I don't know if there's always see your wholesome hours no like not I just couldn't imagine not drinking on using marijuana he had imagined all right 
T:	so you can't imagine that so is look at the other side can you imagine having further instance with law enforcement we're charges in the future
C:	if I hadn't really sort of that I mean that I don't want there today I guess I would want this to kind of like go as smoothly as possible to not get any more charges or anything like that not be in the situation again
T:	so you could kind of picture an outcome where you beat these charges or there's not a really heavy consequence and you'll be more careful in the future
C:	I don't know yeah I guess so I guess I probably just wouldn't drive if I like was just working like right before try to like avoid that situation again 
T:	so with that thinking you continue to use as you were that you take out the part that got you in trouble
C:	yeah 
T:	the first you have to get out of trouble this time yep so if you could have the pain and anxiety go away without the alcohol marijuana would you continue to use it
C:	I just couldn't imagine getting to a place where that wasn't what was like helping me and then to like I don't I took mostly by myself but I couldn't imagine like it's my friends called me up and said hey you would want to go out tonight like not drinking with them 
T:	so there's a social component here 
C:	yeah a little bit I drink mainly by myself just because all my friends work like  jobs they dont trick every day but I do but like on the weekend things like all my friends who I do have it all to drink
T:	alright so you know if you had no anxiety no pain you'd have to give up at least those interactions with your friends mm-hmm how would they respond if you went out with them
C:	I didn't drink um they probably just like wouldn't understand it because we all go out and we got like really drunken I would just feel like ass please so it'd be socially awkward yeah straining the relationships with your friends 
T:	so the quitting alcohol and marijuana like stopping use that doesn't seem like a good rap for you know but then you have this this recent situation which is making you second guess some of it 
C:	yeah I mean it's making me think that like maybe I I need to like make a change I just can't see that that's the change of making 
T:	so you need to make some change 
C:	yeah 
T:	but not the alcohol and drugs 
C:	yeah alcohaulin I want something else could change yeah I don't know what 
T:	but you have any theories 
C:	um I mean I just thinking like just like cutting back on it and like not drinking and driving obviously because that's literally got me into situation that was other than that not really and I really never thought of what I could do 
T:	so you could reduce your usage avoid driving and that might that might get you to your goal would that be enough usage to stop the anxiety in the name 
C:	I might just not go anywhere ever I'm not sure drivers often because I don't know if I would if I'd be able to cut back drinking enough to like not have to like feel
T:	okay so that strategy might not work that's something you've been tossed around though this ideas isolate a little bit more and drinking a little less seems like all your options here kind of ground yeah that just such as mayor's it seemed that way to you too now that I'm like talking through it
C:	yeah as I don't think I have any choice really you know of any choice what's gonna happen is going to happen I don't know 
T:	oh really oh alright so what store do we know or pick up with what we know you don't want to make a bad impression in this whole court proceeding with the deal I what do you think you could do that would make a bad impression 
C:	go to court strong test positive as I get drug tested that would do it get another DUI in the meantime I would look good either
T:	alright so you want to avoid those behaviors for sure so you know for sure you don't want to do those things would it be acceptable to do this thing's anyone
C:	I mean not really i mean i think i could avoid the knowledge drunk driving enough or maybe not to wreck the day of my court date but I don't know about the holy SH marijuana part tougher 
T:	yeah all right so would you appreciate those as goals like avoiding those situations like going the court chug yeah goals that you could get behind home come in 
C:	I can try I guess to like think about it and try to get out I know I'm going to stress out the day of my court date 
T:	well it's gonna be hard to like not turn that day you're not striking me is overly enthusiastic about this idea this is this is really tough for you if the alcohol in the marijuana that are important to you yeah this hold this so do you I think it's really just encroached on somebody at going on that you enjoyed yeah so is this an inconvenience that you can move past or is this a major life event that does that change things 
C:	I don't know because I don't know any other like way around it centered dealing with it I mean if I like don't go to quarter into that's going to warrant out for me I can't it can't wait this situation 
T:	what if as a condition of your treatment the judge says no more drinking in the more marijuana period like it's either that you obey those rules or or jail now so they wouldn't get to that
C:	I know it possibly could it's probably well but i don't know i would think it all certainly would ya yeah I don't know what I'm gonna do I can't imagine like not drinking and using drugs I'm sure I was like leave court that day thinking I would but I don't know what happened when i get home for the next day or the next day let's go back a couple of steps
T:	how long have you been used in the alcohol marijuana
C:	for about like six years six years 
T:	have ever until now with the DUI have you ever envision stopping know what's your plan like pre do you i will is your plan in all this
C:	I just kinda like the drinking kind of has gotten worse wasn't always that bad if only g marijuana but the alcohol i guess i've been using a little bit more recently so I didn't really ever have a plan the marijuana never really expected my life too much but i guess the alcohol has been a little bit more 
T:	yeah so without this or something you would have continued using yeah weird years to come
C:	yeah I didn't really have any like I never liked thought I want to stop doing this or anything like that or had a reason to or this home now yeah could this be in a strange way like an opportunity I mean I guess if I had if I wanted to stop this would be a way for me to stop or reason for me to stop
T:	if you really wanted to stop could you stop 
C:	I don't know magus I could try but I don't have the one 
T:	you could give a shot you're just not sure you could you could actually do it 
C:	yeah I mean I've never tried to before so I don't know it's just unknown yeah 
T:	yeah so what do you want to go from here you have this to you I I imagine a hearing some time coming up right here to see me what can I do to help you 
C:	I guess yes help me figure out whether or not like i do want to stop trickier ease and ROK's I mean that might be something that I have to do right now I don't really want to don't know if I could like get to a place where i actually 
T:	you want to stop it be easier to actually do it then like a like a place in terms of your thinking like your mentality 
C:	yeah 
T:	okay do you want to work on that
C:	yeah I think that'd be good
T:	alright so between now I'm going to see again do you have any hearings or anything coming up no they're not for like a few more weeks few more weeks hi so I'll see you again and I have the iop and everything here I'll see you again in a week and let's pick up with that anything changes we're hearing is moved up just slumming now okay thanks Mel B
