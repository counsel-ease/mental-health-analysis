T:	I was Jones nice to see you again
C:	doctor how are you today
T:	I'm doing great things now we have about 15 minutes today and I want to make sure that we talk about what's important to you however I do want to take some time at the beginning to talk about your recent lab work would that be okay
C:	oh definitely I mean I guess that's something I should be concerned about with you bringing it up I knew my blood pressure so going up a little bit but I didn't know anything else was a concern
T:	the blood sugars have increased some so you're concerned that things are not as good as they were last time that we talked
C:	yeah that's right I did notice that my morning blood sugars were coming up a little bit I just didn't realize how serious it was
T:	right why I'd certainly didn't mean to startle you but there has been a significant increase in your that a1c that three-month average on your blood sugar yeah so that's gone from you've been doing so great we'd brought it down from over 9 to about 7.5 and now it's kind of bounced back up to 8.4 and I'm wondering if you had any ideas as to why that might have happened
C:	well you know I was reading about the januvia that we added and read some concerning things on the internet it might cause pancreatitis and cancer and I just was scared to death of that so I stopped taking my medication I guess I should have told you about that
T:	um telling me would have been great but that's okay I mean you had a concern about a medication that you dread some things about and you stopped the medication I think that's a good thing that's a good decision
C:	wow I'm glad to know you're not too angry with me you know we're not I've read that cancer was a possibility it just terrified me because my mother had died of breast cancer and I just didn't want any of that
T:	how long ago was that
C:	oh it's it's been a little while but it was the tough process and I certainly don't want to see myself there
T:	so the concern of cancer was probably the main thing that me
C:	yes
T:	but stop the medication
C:	well and you know - sometimes I didn't feel so good when you know the new medication combines with the metformin that I was on sometimes I would be nauseous and just uncomfortable
T:	so you were nauseated anything else
C:	Oh sometimes diarrhea and sometimes the nausea was so bad even one day I didn't go to work
T:	so quite a bit of nausea the diarrhea and then you also have that fear of cancer
C:	yes
T:	um how are you feeling now
C:	well you know I guess my thoughts are that if I don't have to take so much medication you know that would make me feel better too many pills you know I just feel like I shouldn't be taking so much medication but obviously we do have to do something about the blood sugar
T:	tell me what you know about the consequences of having high blood sugars that are untreated
C:	well I know you know in reading on the internet and doing my research certainly could end up blind or on dialysis and I know some people have even lost limbs that's really scary to me I don't want that either
T:	so on the one hand there are some things that really scare you about having diabetes that's uncontrolled and on the other hand it's been difficult for you I know we've talked in the past about working on controlling your your diet and looking at your way so where does that leave you at this point
C:	well I guess if I don't want to take more pills I have to give up some of my sweets my cookies and my potato chips
T:	so those types of sweets and crunchy stuff and salty stuff is is pretty important to you
C:	yeah I'm a snacker unfortunately and it's always been hard that was my downfall every time I've tried to dye it before giving up the carbs was just so hard for me
T:	so some of the problems you've had in the past you've had some failures you you've tried something tummy tell me a little bit more about some of the things that you've tried already
C:	well you know I've tried to Adkins in the past and it actually worked for me for a little while once I got used to it but then I just felt sluggish like I had no energy and and even kind of felt depressed
T:	so you felt fatigued and somewhat depressed while you were on the Atkins diet that's something I hear not yeah pretty it's pretty often I think that if it's okay we could talk about that for a minute if that's something
C:	sure I'd like that
T:	so carbohydrates actually do make us feel better they actually raise something called serotonin
C:	no wonder I like them so much
T:	all right have you heard of serotonin
C:	yes I had
T:	asked kind of a happy horn but yeah so as we do eat simple carbohydrates in particular those rays are our serotonin levels so that we actually do feel better and so some people on the Atkins diet actually do feel depressed and fatigued because their your serotonin levels aren't as high but that can be a dangerous cycle because as we raise our blood sugar you know we feel good if it's as if it's a simple sugar though blood sugar goes up insulin goes up we tend to crash we tend to eat more which tends to do the cycle of carbohydrate cravings
C:	so that's why I crave that bag of potato chips
T:	I think I
C:	don't make sense
T:	yeah so um what sort of things can you think about that could maybe calm those blood sugar swings down
C:	Wow I guess that I don't know enough about nutrition and diet I guess I need more information you know food has always been a Comfort thing for me my family gets together we have big meals need around the holidays so you know it's hard when you give up those things that you really love to stay focused so I guess that need more information
T:	sounds like there's a lot of emotional investment for you and your family around food that can make things more difficult and that those may be some barriers that we need to talk about if it's okay would it be alright if we talked a little bit more about some of the other low carb diets that are out there
C:	sure
T:	and what do you know about low carb diets can you you know if any that come to mind
C:	well I think I've heard about South Beach and of course Adkins that we mentioned um are there others
T:	there are there's a couple out there one called protein power and but a lot of my patients have had a lot of luck with South Beach diet wouldn't be already I'm
C:	sure I'd like that
T:	well early on in the South Beach the first two weeks is called phase one and that's a very low carb time but during that time carbohydrate cravings people tell me typically really really calm down but even in that first phase in South Beach you can have again healthy salads and healthy carbohydrates then you kind of build on up and even in level two there are some actually healthy cookie recipes
C:	oh wow that's exciting
T:	so in a limited state we may be able to give you some of your cookies back mmm so shown
C:	um I just might can try this
T:	so on a scale of zero to ten ten being really ready to make a change zero being really not ready at all where do you think you are at this point
C:	well you know I I think I'm a nine I think you know I really don't want to take the medication I'm afraid of cancer and other side effects from too many meds I've got to do something about the blood sugar spikes and what you're telling me I'm outside South Beach sounds like maybe I can do that
T:	that sounds like you're fairly ready to do something that's good and how do you think will deal with some of these carbohydrate cravings
C:	Wow well I guess I need a support group I need you know somebody I can turn to when I'm having a tough day and also more information about the snacks I can't have that will make me healthier
T:	right okay so one of the great things about South Beach is I think it's for $7.99 a month or something like that you can get tied in and have your own registered dietician did you have regular appointments with
C:	that would be awesome
T:	yeah and they can help you through recipes and and also give you some strategies on the carbohydrate cravings so does that make sense
C:	sounds like a plan I really am excited about this as a possibility
T:	okay well you're you're obviously a very inquisitive and intelligent lady and I think you'll have good success with this the other thing that we can offer is we do have a weight management support group here at the practice that meets on a weekly basis and I think quite a few of those folks are also doing the the South Beach so having some of that social facilitation may help as well is that something you think we might be interested in
C:	yes I think that would be great
T:	Miss Jones you had said that uh maybe your confidence level wasn't too great because of some of the failures and kind of stop starts that you'd had in the past so if I can use another one of those scales on a confidence 0 being no confidence at all that you can do this or 10 being very confidence you can do this where do you think you are in terms of
C:	Stefan maybe even an eighth that this will work for me this time I'm feeling better
T:	tell me more about why a 7 or an 8 and not 4 or 5
C:	the support-group sound great the the website with the diet and the recipes and all of the things to support me in doing this and if the South Beach diet is going to help me with my carb cravings this might work
T:	good so it sounds like we have a plan if it's ok I'll again give you this information sheet that has the website information and costs and that sort of thing we'll give you the information on the weight management support group and there's even some information on exercise there if that's something that you're interested in at some point and and if it's ok we'll see you back in 2 or 3 weeks is there a day miss change that would be best for you to start this diet
C:	well I need a little time to buy the right foods and read up on the the diet and information and the recipes maybe Monday would be good
T:	so Monday very good it sounds like we have a plan
C:	right thank you doctor
T:	thank you for your time and we'll see you in several weeks
C:	ok
T:	bye
