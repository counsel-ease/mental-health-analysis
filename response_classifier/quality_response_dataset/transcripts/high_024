T:	what do you feel about the possibility of doing some of that thinking and looking in with another person I hear you clearly saying I don't need you know help I don't need therapy I don't need treatment of any kind but I'm thinking about the exploration area of that and whether or not you have thoughts on how helpful it might be to sit down and be able to sort of chat with somebody about the connection between the alcohol issue and the anger issue and coming back from the war issue and that kind of thing
C:	i'd be willing to explore it like I said I think I can handle these issues on my own
T:	so here feeling kind of two ways but I kind of feel like to get it on my own but on the other hand I would be willing to talk to somebody
C:	right
T:	such as my girlfriend wants me to do and it sounds like there's some reasons that you've got for doing that one of which is a relationship can you think of other reasons that would support the notion of just coming into to chat again and down the road
C:	well I don't like where my anger is at I do not like that if talking to you someone like yourself would would help in those areas and not be willing to do that
T:	so the one thing that you and your girlfriend Sharon color is that you want change with respect to this anger issue of the
C:	anger issue
T:	and it sounds like it needs to change
C:	it's just not healthy
T:	yeah gotcha so I wonder if I can move that then to this whole issue of commandment I hear you saying pretty loud and clear I am committed to the relationship I will do what it takes and maybe I would be willing to the level of six to come in and chat with somebody about it down the road would it be help for me to to offer you sort of a smorgasbord or a menu of what we have to offer here and see if any of those view at all
C:	sure
