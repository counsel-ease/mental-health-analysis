T:	great session today Brian you're really making great improvements in all the areas that we've been focusing on you know you've met all your goals that we set for you when you initially came in and I think you're just about ready to be discharged great so I'd like to take the last couple of minutes of today's session to try and make sure we carry over the results that we made in physical therapy into your daily schedule
C:	okay
T:	this will help keep your body strong resilience outside of the clinic so that hopefully your previous recording there's a back pain do not return okay so before we do this I'd like to read explore why you sought out physical therapy in the first place okay does it sound okay to you
C:	yeah it does you know the you know ever since the new year I've been trying to get back into you know being more active and playing basketball and all that stuff but I've been seems like I'm hitting a wall quite a bit
T:	okay
C:	I have a lot of obstacles and having trouble getting through it
T:	okay well tell me more about the kinds of things that you were doing and why he seems to be hitting these road bumps along the way
C:	so as you as you know my buddy's been playing you know basketball pickup and I've been trying to do trying to do that and that caused me some back pain in the past and it's been a struggle for me to do that so I went to doctor and the doctor gave me some some pain medication and the pain medication worked for for a while but it seemed like it didn't really take care of it so then I started I try I try to try to do basketball again but then I had more pain from that so I'm really stuck with it with going back to basketball because it's a pain
T:	well it sounds like you you've really struggled that back get back into a more active lifestyle and understand how difficult it is to overcome these roadblocks and INSAT all over again so tell me everything else is going are you eating well sleeping well are there any other stressors in your life
C:	well I have been trying to eat better but it's been quite difficult to maintain for a pro for a long period of time work is getting busier and I'm getting closer to about six hours a night but three things definitely isn't the best for me you know I feel much better when I'm exercising but when this back pain calmed on everything just seems to fall apart and definitely makes me less active
T:	well you did have some success and you felt much better when you initially tried to become more active
C:	yeah I did I definitely felt a lot better felt like I was like turning a new chapter in my life and I'd like to think that I would being more proactive about my health
T:	okay well it sounds like you realized that when you started to change these aspects of your life you felt much better and that it was going to affect your overall health but it's recurring back pain that you experienced was stopping you in your tracks so tell me what do you think that you're experiencing these recurring bouts of back pain in the first place
C:	I don't think I was in the proper physical shape to be playing basketball you know with my friends you know I said that at a desk for about eight hours a day and I go from there to play in basketball the rest and the medications didn't have some positive effects initially but it seemed like they were not helping overall yes a pain came right back
T:	I think I think you're right you know pain does not necessarily mean that there's a physical problem it sometimes just means that the brain is perceiving a stress and that something needs to change there are many other things that play into why pain comes about for example how much stress you're under your productivity level much sleep you're getting your emotional health they all play a big role as well you know if one aspect of your lifestyle is not deemed healthy then it can certainly make you more sensitive to experiencing pain I think you touched on an important point earlier when you said that you didn't feel physically ready to jump back into playing pick-up basketball with your friends after sitting for long periods of time throughout the day does this make sense to you
C:	yes I definitely think so I mean working eight hours a day and going to play basketball my body was
T:	definitely not ready for that definitely you know because many factors influence we have a lot of options on how to decrease pain and make sure that it doesn't return now you're doing very well about being proactive about getting back into a more active lifestyle but I think that the physical capability good body just wasn't there yet to jump into playing basketball with your friends at that intensity and I think that was a big reason why you experience back pain in the first place and also why it's been recurring what's your impression on that
C:	well I definitely understand that you know I really haven't exercised in a couple years and because everything's been pretty crazy at home very hectic lots of hours at home or kids have been busy things that in the job is very busy just hectic I thought playing basketball be great for me I think it is but I definitely wasn't ready to step right back in and I didn't realize my body needed more more preparedness to give into that
T:	you have to think of your body is a complex ecosystem where a number of different factors mixed to create your pain you know as we touched on before things like how much stress you're under your emotional health your beliefs and aggravating activities in your case basketball they all come into play so we really don't know exactly how pain is influenced by all of these different factors but we do know that it's very helpful to address many areas of your life but as we spoke about before these factors all interrelate so when it hurts you stop exercising which changes your general wellness your mood and your social supports and so on and so forth but it's important to note though that things can change you know so we can start with your activities you know what do you think that you can do in order to be more physically active but reduce the risk of the back pain returning and the additional negative effects that accompany that
C:	well I guess I could go for short walks with my wife after work definitely be less stress on my body and be some type of exercise for me in terms of work it would make sense if I got up once in a while from my chair and just walk around that would make sense and it'd be good for me
T:	great it sounds like we're off to a great start it's important to note though that there are many different exercises that can help you you know you need to gradually expose yourself to increasingly demanding tasks you know we start with walking let your body adapt as you have been locked tolerance you can keep moving forward so let me ask you how important is it to you to improve your consistency with exercise in order to enhance your health
C:	yeah certainly I definitely feel that consistency is important untie I'm tired of starting and stopping starting and stopping I definitely want to be more consistent
T:	brilliant you've got it consistency is key you know so how how often do you think that you'll be able to exercise
C:	well my wife walks four or five times a week and each time she walks is about thirty minutes I could probably do that also at work I think I could get up and walk around every up you know these once every hour
T:	sounds like a brilliant start so let me ask you on a scale of zero to ten zero being not confident at all and ten being 100% confident how confident are you that you will be able to stay consistent with this new exercise regime
C:	I would probably say about a six or seven
T:	but you're not a zero that tells me you've got some confidence in making a change so let me ask you why are you confident you know
C:	as I said before I'm tired of starting stopping and I'm just tired that and I also I think I could lose I could use to lose a few pounds
T:	okay so you realize that if you become more consistent with exercise and moving Moore's work you're going to feel better and you're held to be impacted positively
C:	yes I definitely think so
T:	but you're not a 10 that tells me that there may be some obstacles to your success what would it take for you to be a 10 or even an eight or a nine
C:	I think if I give my my whole family involved that will certainly help also if I can set you know small realistic goals for myself I think that will keep keep me motivated you know in the past you know like we talked about a few times already that you know I'm always stopping and starting I think if I if I do those things I won't I won't do that and also I think that I'll stay more motivated and there to help you probably lead myself to better healthier lifestyle
T:	brilliant I get the impression that you want to stay on course with starting an exercise regime and experience in less pain the best way to do this is as we said staying consistent and setting small goals for yourself to keep motivated you know your ecosystem will adapt to be more active and you slowly begin to do more and your pain will slowly begin to subside during this progression it's important to note as well to keep slowly building up and not to put a limit on what you can do later down the road as I sort of build confidence and increase the strength and resiliency of your body so if I saw you in two weeks what would you tell me with regards to hell your new exercise regime is going
C:	I will tell you that I'm consistent I will tell you I'm feeling much better I'll tell you I would probably have little pain if any and I'll tell you I'm more active in an overall I just tell you I'm very healthy
T:	good good sounds brilliant you know so using that same scale from zero to ten how confident are you that you'll be able to stay consistent with this new exercise regime
C:	definitely attend definitely
T:	I agree you know overall most comments in your brain let's see you in two weeks crazy idea
C:	okay perfect thank you
