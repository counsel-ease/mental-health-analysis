T:	you had a much stronger positive reaction
C:	yeah
T:	all right I have some more questions for you these have to do with a little little bit different topic but just same you know similarly if any of these kind of resonate with you if you've gone through them just something that
C:	okay
T:	and this is I can't as with these other items this is symptoms I'm talking about it happen after or became worse after the trauma okay that's occurred or became hoarse after the trauma after it happened so have you found that your have angry outburst or you're more irritable more likely to express physical or verbal aggression how about any reckless or self-destructive behavior has that been a problem have you found yourself more aware of your environment my potential dangers
C:	like yeah yeah I'm just waiting like I actually you know I usually plug the curling iron in before or I go you know and do my stuff in via the bathroom in the morning and I've been feeling weird about it and you not come back in check it actually I only went earlier and I want him in the room so yeah and just sort of overall I've been feeling kind of just really aware of you know what could hurt me what could hurt her
T:	even more aware of your environment channel
C:	oh definitely for threats looking for us
T:	yeah like this curling iron could start a fire you know even driving you know what
C:	so tell me about how you assess threats before the trauma he feels the same way or different
T:	well no I I guess I didn't really think about it as much before I mean that sounds kind of bad but now I'm thinking about it all the time you know even like somebody coming down the street like could he'd be dangerous should we move you know the other side of the street I said about you know definitely of things that could start a fire in the house and yeah I'm just really paranoid it seems a lot about you know our safety

T:	not really
C:	okay the dreams may change in your dreams and them distressing to ever feel like you're reliving the moment when the trauma occurred had other similar events brought out a strong reaction from you like other other stories of fires is that because that may have you had any cause of effect and a sense of fear or anxiety or terror say I'm gonna keep moving forward through some of these the questions I have to ask you in regard to this event do you find yourself avoiding making efforts to avoid memories thoughts or feelings so you associated with this event
T:	I have a lot of thoughts about it a lot of memories about it I think I've just kind of got to work through them you know we had this really sad but I can't let it roll my life you said it
C:	you're more confronting them than avoiding them it sounds like
T:	I guess uh yeah
C:	okay how about right making any effort to avoid things that might remind you of the event like people places situations activities anything like that
T:	not really I Drive by the fire I have fire house on my way to work most mornings like I see it and I think about that day but you know Who am I gonna do try six months out of my way you know I don't think so yeah
C:	you're not really you know they try to avoid any reminders at this time so I have some other questions now about emotional state I appreciate your patience and with these questions they're kind of mostly related to your mood and much I to understand how your voice but since the dramatic event do you find yourself any trouble remembering anything about the traumatic event have you noticed since the event that you have any kind of exaggerated negative beliefs about the world or yourself other people okay how about distorted thinking surrounding what would caused the event
