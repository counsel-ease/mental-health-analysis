T:	hi Tom how are you today
C:	yeah going well thanks
T:	so before we begin let's update your medical history it's important we're doing this at each time because your oral health can affect your general health and vice versa are you taking any new medication as a moment no if you had any major surgery or serious illness in the past six months no have no changes
C:	that's great were there any concerns today
T:	yes I've been been in for a while but lately I've noticed these white spots appearing on my teeth they've sure that they're before
C:	ok shall we check them out. ok Tom so these white spots they're actually the first sign of decay what I'd like to do is help you work how why you've develop our developing them in the first place do you mind if I ask you a few questions
T:	yeah sure that's fine
C:	excellent so I might do that we might get you to do what's called a risk assessment form so it's just here
T:	yep
C:	I'm just getting you to fill that one out for us
T:	yep
C:	excellent thank you says here that you're having one can of soft drink a day but you're spending a bit of time drinking that
T:	yeah that's right um usually have it around lunchtime and I just slowly sip it throughout the afternoon that way I don't feel like having another can later I just have the one can
C:	that's great but you only went in here and take a soft drink Tom however it's also important how you drink it do you understand why sugar and acid are bad for your teeth
T:	yeah see online all the time about how sugars really bad for your teeth so I try not to eat like lollies and other stuff like that too much
C:	that's great that you're trying to you know limit your intake of sugar and all is it definitely not a too friendly food the issue is sugar is that it feeds the bacteria in your mouth to produce acid and this acid bathing the tooth surface eventually leads to holes and that's why it's really important to limit the time spent sipping that soft drink in the afternoon because the longer your teeth are exposed to that acid the more damage you can do did you know there's actually 10 2 teaspoons of sugar in one can of soft drink
T:	no I didn't know that what if I just switched to diet soft drink instead there's no sugar in that right
C:	well Tom it's great to think you're being proactive about improving your health other studies show that diets offstring still has a high acid content that dissolves your teeth every time you take a few
T:	okay well just like I got the chance can I ask you about this thing I've read online so it's where people swish coconut oil in their mouth and they use that to just stop the hulls from forming and they do that for about ten minutes should I give that a shot
C:	it's great to see that you're doing some you know your own research about help online and what you're referring to is actually called oil pulling there's not actually any strong scientific evidence to show that it prevents holes in your teeth I can see that you're really motivated to you know make some changes how about we talk about some ways we can simplify your oral health routine
T:	yes it sounds good
C:	so first of all getting back to the risk assessment can I suggest that one can of soft drink we try to either drink it all in one go perhaps limiting you to about 10 minutes and even consider using a straw when you drink it
T:	yeah well usually have it around lunchtime so I could just have it all in one shot then
C:	great that will give your teeth a break from all that sugar and acid in the afternoon and perhaps you could keep a glass of water handy instead Tom on a scale of one to ten ten being the most one being the less how motivated do you think you are to make these changes
T:	well I really don't want these spots turning into holes so I say about eight or nine
C:	grain and we can talk about other ways you can simplify your drinks between meals
T:	yeah sounds good
C:	excellent so one suggestion is to keep a bottle of water handy and sip that through the afternoon instead and perhaps even try some sugar-free chewing gum however I'll just try and keep it to ten minutes otherwise it won't lead to a bit of tooth wear and you could get a sore jaw
T:	okay then I'll think about those ideas
C:	oh that's great so what I'll do Tom I'll make a note on your chart and then next time you're in will check in and see how you've gone with that yeah it sounds good
