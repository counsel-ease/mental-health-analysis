T:	wanted to talk to you because I was on Facebook the other day and saw some pictures from a party we're at and made me a little bit concerned because I saw you were drinking and I wonder if you can tell me a little bit about how alcohol fits in your life 
C:	I mainly just drink whenever I'm at parties or whenever somebody hands me a beer out I'll take sips every now and then but it's not something that I feel hovers around my life  
T:	it's kind of a social thing for you not like a major priority yeah how much do you think you're drinking 
C:	I guess I would say like every other every other weekend maybe a breathe every two weeks on occasion maybe if there's a basketball game going on or a football game I'll have a beer just to drink with my boys but other than that I don't really see it as much of a of a problem  
T:	so you're drinking maybe half the time depending on what's going on that weekend yeah I guess you can say that well how would you describe the difference between weekends when you drink versus ones when you don't 
C:	um when I'm not drinking I'm usually more like involved in doing like more productive things like I I try and do more school work whenever I have the time or whatever I like I can go work out or something just like when whenever I'm drinking I devote my time to just letting loose and having fun and just relaxing with friends  
T:	okay so you you feel like you get more stuff done on weekends when you don't drink but maybe you don't feel like you can relax as well 
C:	yeah I mean I whenever I'm drinking I know that I'm devoting time to to not doing other things so I try and make it so that I don't allow myself to pile on so much work so I try and like get work done before but I know that drinking gets in the way of productivity so I'd try and minimize that as much as possible  
T:	you're trying to be responsible and get your stuff done yeah knowing that the drinking is gonna make it harder yeah and it sounds like are you getting everything done or some stuff sort of slipping when you drink 
C:	yeah I guess when I drink some things do slip a little bit but just because like when I'm drinking I'm I'm not really focused on what I have to do I'm focused on the moment and just enjoying the time that I have at that time and it's really something that I just it's something of an like a pleasure giver so I can enjoying a joint enjoyment type of thing  
T:	what are the things you enjoy about the drinking 
C:	just the way that it it's sort of like liberates you it makes you it makes you feel like a more confident more energetic person that you don't feel like yourself you feel like a different version of yourself and it's something that you it it's just empowering to a degree  
T:	okay so you feel liberated or kind of more confident in some ways yeah yeah  
T:	okay are there any not-so-good things about drinking 
C:	um whenever I drink too much I sort of lose control of myself and I I had just a like the aftermath of whenever I drank too much or whenever I my friends mix drinks and it just has a harmful effect in my body and that's probably one of the major drawbacks that I have from drinking  
T:	what kinds of things happen 
C:	I mainly when when I puke or it's just the feeling that I get in my stomach if I drink too much it's just very over like you notice in your body doing  
T:	how much do you think is the most you've ever drank in one time 
C:	Wow i would say probably at a friend one of my friends had a birthday party recently and he wanted to let loose it was it was just a all the guys were together and they had a couple of friends over and it just turned into one big party and i just i losted I drank way too much I would say like probably a bottle or two and just some beers along the way I got to a point where I lost count  
T:	that was out of the ordinary for you don't just count what's a more typical amount that you drink 
C:	um I don't let myself drink more than three or four beers on a given night just because I know I'm I've gotten to the point where I sort of know my limit but I kind of flirt with my limit just to see how far I can go and I think that that sort of is very dangerous to play with fire but I chi I want to see how far I can go just so I know not to go that far  
T:	got it so you're you're sort of testing and pushing it and yeah and sometimes crossing that limit and having some of the consequences that you mentioned yeah
C:	just so I know how it feels now so that later on when this the situation is more drastic and more out of control I know what I can do or where my limit is that 
T:	okay what kind of along those lines looking ahead you know five years from now what do you see as a goal for yourself in terms of career wise in terms of what do you think you'll be doing in five years and I would love to be I would
C:	love to travel I would love to see the world for what it is and I've always seen pictures and videos of how the world is but I've never really experienced that like I've always wanted to travel to Europe or China or something or some place like that so I can really experience the the world that we live in  
T:	so getting a full experience is really important to you it sounds like throughout your life we talked about wanting to make the most of your high school experience and now you're looking ahead to think of how you can enrich your life in other ways 
C:	how do you think drinking too much would fit into you know being able to experience life to its fullest  I guess it could interfere with allowing myself to feel the effects of living life to the fullest but I wouldn't want to tamper with drinking too much like often just because I know I've seen the consequences that drinking has on people and I know that I would never want to get to a degree where I need to drink constantly every single day I don't want to ever get to that point  
T:	okay so just to kind of summarize what you've told me so far you're you're drinking pretty regularly but you are trying to limit yourself you feel like three drinks maybe is probably the maximum that you can drink before you're having some of these negative consequences and it and you feel better if you limit yourself to three or less yeah I feel more in control mm-hmm and then kind of looking ahead you you don't want to find yourself being someone who's drinking all the time or someone who feels out of control what they're drinking that you've seen that maybe in other people's lives and it's not appealing to it all and and you do have some big goals for your life that you want to achieve that drinking too much could also interfere with so where do you think you want to go from here with your with regard to your drinking 
C:	um maybe now that I know my limits to an extent I kind of don't want to push it so so much I now that I know what I can do and where I can go I would like to mitigate that as much as possible i just wanna I wanna have fun being me but I don't want me to be influenced by alcohol so much like I want to live the dis over life to an extent but I know that alcohol it's just gonna tamper with it  
T:	so for right now it feels like a reasonable goal for you would be to sort of limit your drinking and make sure you're you're stopping at three for example or maybe even limiting the number of times that you're drinking 
C:	yeah or like not like not drinking like in the mornings or just just strictly for social purposes like not just to not have it around like I don't want to have it like in my fridge if my parents have it I don't want I don't want to have to deal with it  
T:	okay what do you see as some benefits to that benefits intelligence is sticking to those limits 
C:	I guess I could definitely be I could live a more fulfilled life to an extent like I could possibly be more productive more efficient in my work and where I can possibly be in the next few years of my life and I think that by not drinking I it will definitely have a better effect on my life 
T:	yeah I think taking steps to limit and cut back on your drinking is a really good idea you know I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with me about it and being open and honest pleasure you know if you don't mind I would like to talk to you probably about this in a couple weeks or a couple months just kind of check in how things are going right all right sounds good thank you very much
