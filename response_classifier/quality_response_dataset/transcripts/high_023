T:	well let's talk about then how you ended up cutting yourself
C:	I'm pretty obvious
T:	so what happened first of all tell me what you did exactly
C:	what you mean what I did
T:	well I mean where'd you cut yourself I know you said you cut yourself with a name as always same as always
C:	or your arm
T:	yeah
C:	where'd you get your stuff left and right there hug it
T:	want to see it
C:	yeah
T:	can you say hey you can oh those look to me like they they did you go does it it doesn't look like you went and got any stitches but that looks to me like you could have used them what do you think
C:	I think have you ever been to it er when you cut yourself even though I don't go
T:	okay part of the problem is those look deep in like you're going to have significant force so my suggestion is in the future if you do is that you put some sort of bandaid on it to keep it closed now let's talk about how how this happened list of all tell me you were telling me on that phone that you wanted to die but did you assist a suicide attempt or do things just to cutting your thinking about killing yourself of wanting to kill yourself of wanting to die and again
C:	thinking about killing myself you thought you would help me and you didn't that's what I want to talk about I want to talk about how it is that my life is not going better and you are not helping me and you are not available to me when I need help okay
T:	so let's okay so it sounds like me not being a bit with me not being available if you rate related to you cutting yourself
C:	I cut myself the first time to call you thinking you would help me you wouldn't help me so then I figured what the hell I might as well just go all the way and so that's why I cut myself deep
