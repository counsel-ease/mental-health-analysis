T:	Hi Emily how are you
C:	I'm doing right how are you
T:	I'm good um Wow what's changed what do we have here
C:	oh I got my lip pierced
T:	Emily why why did you get your lip pierced
C:	why I don't wanted to change and you can kind of cool
T:	gorgeous your teeth are lovely you do not need a piercing
C:	I mean nobody needs up here saying I wanted one or then
T:	do you know what those oral piercings can do to your teeth
C:	I mean it's my lip that's pierced not my teeth
T:	well yes except that you know what's going to happen see how do you feel how when you're moving your lips smile for me okay so do you see how when your muscles are moving that piercing is rubbing against your gums as well as your teeth so we can see some recession that's going to start to happen
C:	yeah
T:	possibly affecting the tooth itself chipping the tooth etc so it's something that we definitely don't like to see
C:	I mean it's been okay so far it doesn't cause me any problems
T:	well it's only been a month
C:	yeah
T:	okay orderly days yet and it might not be a bad idea to reconsider the piercing
C:	I mean I just chose it I'm not going to take it right out it's like you said I've only had it in for a month I mean
T:	Emily I've been seeing you for so long and you know that I really just I think you have lovely teeth and I've watched you you know just mature etc and I hate I'd hate to see you wreck your teeth for something like this I really would
C:	well I mean if it starts to cause a problem then maybe talk about but at this point I mean
T:	all right all right okay okay okay we'll continue the exam but you know where I stand on this okay
C:	all right
T:	all right
