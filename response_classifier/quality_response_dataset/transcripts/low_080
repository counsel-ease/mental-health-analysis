T:	Can I help you 
C:	uh yeah I just got off work and apparently they're going smoke-free so I'm I thought I'd stop by the pharmacy here and see what my options are some of my friends have tried nicotine patches and they say they don't work very well I don't really want to quit smoking I just need somebody to get me through the day 
T:	so you want nicotine replacement but you don't want to quit smoking 
C:	maybe like that during the day nicotine replacement is that I mean do y'all have anything like that 
T:	we don't really recommend that the ideas you would use the nicotine replacement to actually quit so then you wouldn't be smoking at work but you also wouldn't be smoking the rest of the time either 
C:	well I don't really want to quit I mean I like smoking I'll go like after work they have a beer with my friends not smoke cigarettes I mean it's not really a big deal cigarettes aren't that bad I me I know that the it's popular to say that smoking is bad for you but you know I like it so I'm gonna keep doing it
T:	okay well smoking really is really bad for you you know it causes things like lung cancer emphysema heart disease 
C:	yeah okay oh well what are my options you know I assuming that I'm right what are my options 
T:	well to be honest with you you mentioned the patch I can't recommend a patch to you if you're gonna continue smoking that can actually be pretty dangerous for you in order to advise you about this at all I need you to tell me a little bit more about your smoking history and how much you're smoking now 
C:	I mean I spent barely a pack a day I mean I probably smoked about five or six years now it's not really a lot of cigarettes but it's sort of hard to get through the day work
T:	okay well we actually considered  cigarettes a day to be a significant amount and in fact I would then recommend to you that you would start on the highest dose of nicotine replacement
C:	sounds good to me the more nicotine the better is there like gum or something I could chew it like while I'm in the office that sounds pretty great 
T:	I mean do you have there are some products that you could use to take away some of your cravings and probably the gum would be the best option for you it's not something you would continue to use continuously throughout the day however the gum is something you use just when you have a craving 
C:	oh okay well where's that 
T:	well we have that here but again the the idea would be for you to actually quit smoking 
C:	well I'm probably not gonna buy anything today I just came by to see what my options are I think thanks for the input I mean do you everything else do me other well advice for me 
T:	aside from the gum you could try the nicotine lozenge that would be another option for you again that's not something you'd want to use continuously throughout the day the nicotine patch is the best for continuous nicotine replacement but again that's not something you can use while you're continuing to smoke 
C:	oh okay well thanks i mean i guess that helps a little bit oh maybe i'll be back later Thanks okay
