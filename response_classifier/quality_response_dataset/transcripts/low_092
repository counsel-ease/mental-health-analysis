T:	Mm, except there's nothing funny about mental illness.
C:	Yeah of course.
T:	So depression huh? The big D.
C:	Yeah.
T:	You know, I find it so surprising that people can be depressed nowadays when there's new Star Wars movies coming out, like this guy.
C:	Well those prequels are just so bad.
T:	Well that's your opinion.
C:	Yeah, that's my opinion.
T:	Please describe your symptoms.
C:	Well I'm having trouble sleeping. I feel like I'm having a lot of dark thoughts.
T:	Okay, uh, on a scale of  to , how dark?
C:	Uh I guess I'd say...
T:	being the lowest,  being the highest.
C:	Sure, that's how I assumed. An , I'd say.
T:	Wow, nice.
C:	Yeah, um, I just keep thinking everything is a distraction from our mortality, everything we do is meaningless.
T:	How do those thoughts make you feel?
C:	A lot of the time, I feel like I'm in a state where I don't feel anything at all, but then later on I'll find myself crying for no reason.
T:	Alright, this sounds like you're quoting the Smiths. Are you quoting the Smiths?
C:	I'm sorry?
T:	Are you quoting the Smiths?
C:	No.
T:	Okay. Please continue describing your symptoms.
C:	Uh, alright. It's just, it's just a lot of times I feel overwhelmed by dis--it's not that I want to die, but it's just sometimes I feel like I don't want to live.
T:	Alright there Marcy, I'm your therapist, not your Tumblr.
C:	I don't understanding what you're saying.
T:	It's the oldest trick in the book. A super handsome guy walks into a therapist's office, tricks her with his rustic charms.
C:	Are you saying I'm lying to you right now?
T:	Yeah, yeah I am. And my suspicions were confirmed the moment you started quoting the Smiths.
C:	I-I don't even listen to the Smiths.
T:	Well, oh my gosh, now I know you're lying. Who doesn't listen to the Smiths? Are you sure you like Star Wars?
C:	Why-why would I lie about that?
T:	Did you come here for a prescription for anti-depressants?
C:	Yes, obviously I--
T:	Well people like you disgust me. You know, handsome guys lurking around clubs, selling pills to drunken -somethings who don't know any better.
C:	Stop calling me handsome, alright, that's inappropriate. And who is buying anti-depressants from a guy in a club?
T:	People looking for happy times. Haven't you heard the grin and tonic?
C:	No, what... is that?
T:	Yeah, it's exactly what it sounds like.
C:	This is insane, alright. I think you're the one who needs therapy. I'm-I'm leaving.
T:	Okay, um, so, um, off-topic, would you ever want to get together sometime? We can drink red wine, listen to the Smiths...
C:	Nope, I'm done.
T:	Okay. Okay. Mmm... [the Smiths plays] So handsome... mmm.
