T:	Would you like to answer some questions and kind of do a self evaluation about how you're feeling around alcohol on the contraception
C:	sure
T:	okay so we're working on a 10-point scale of one to ten one being not important can be very important one being not confident one being very confident so on a scale of one to ten which number best reflects how important it is to you to drink the low risk lips
C:	I would say eight
T:	you'd say I'm eight okay and on a scale of one to ten how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below risk levels
C:	I would say a four
T:	amount of four okay and so let's look at those two here you're thinking that's pretty important but your confidence is down here a four but it's not a one what makes you confident that you can drink the low risk levels and you remember what those are
C:	I think it's because you've told me I'm at risk and I have alcoholism in my family and I really don't want to go down that path so I'm confident that I can change that at this point
T:	okay so that gives you a good reason not to drink okay anything else
C:	well I have a group of friends that doesn't drink that I hang out with and I think what I hang out with them it's an issue so that also helps me
T:	so you have a support group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink
C:	yeah
T:	below risk levels
C:	yep
T:	okay anything else
C:	nope
T:	now let's look at your self evaluation of your birth-control views so now we're doing the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control so on a scale of one to ten how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to keep from getting pregnant
C:	I would say an eight
T:	an eight okay and on a scale of one to ten how confident are you at the present time to you that you can use effective birth control
C:	every time
T:	every time
C:	you are sick
T:	correctly as its prescribed at
C:	probably six
T:	probably a six okay so you're pretty confident that you can do it and why are us six and not a two or a three
C:	I'm a six because I think if I drink less I'll be more reliable with using birth control I tend to not use it when I'm I drank too much and I don't really care too much
T:	okay so it's kind of linked to your drinking the fact that that you can if you can take care of that drinking you can take care of the birth control issue and this importance comes down as your reason why you're not down here
C:	yes
T:	very good so it looks like you're using a good method of birth control you're just not able to use it effectively and you've linked it back search of the drinking so would you like to develop a plan around your alcohol use of this today
C:	before I leave
T:	yes
C:	okay
T:	okay and if you need more information we can get that for you
C:	okay
T:	okay
