T:	come in
C:	hello how are you today
T:	I'm very well thank you I just need money repeat prescription and whatsapp for the road doctor
C:	you're ductile
T:	and that's
C:	all right know what when was the last time you got that prescription from us yes I'm surprised did you see the local GP hmm you shouldn't have been given the doctor why do you think you need that no no no you can't you you can't get that drug anymore I'm afraid no no you're not having that trap anymore and it's been proven that that drug is not good for you and so I'm very surprised that the look and gave it to you but we're not doing it anymore yes but it's not it's not fine it's not good for your heart it's causing heart problems and it's been proven that it's not the most effective way to lose weight and what what are you doing about your lifestyle what are you doing about losing weight other than depending on tablets really that's doing a bit more stairs well it's gonna take a bit more than that I think and have you thought about planning in advance if you work you know taking a packed lunch pre-planning your meals and turning to healthy options because really even diet cooks not good for you you should be replacing that with water yeah but I roll the other doctors over wait you know so clearly you could be improving your lifestyle you could take a rap and just have it you know you could make her rap a healthy rap and take it and just have it instead of reaching for a bar of chocolate because that'll also affect your blood pressure and your sugar levels so what I think he should maybe do is maybe just have a maybe do a diary of your lifestyle because well it's I know popping a pill seems like an easy option but really you're gonna have to do the hard work this is only going to come if you get in the right headspace and you start looking at your lifestyle looking at your exercise looking at your eating habits looking at the frequency and your might that you're eating because if you're running about as a doctor you shouldn't beginning we if you if you've got a busy lifestyle you should be losing weight naturally so you there must be something in your daily routine that's stopping you so you maybe need to look and see if you're a comfort eater or what what your triggers are for food and and get that sorted but you know I'm afraid drugs are no longer the answer no I know I you know we would all like a magic wand because it makes life easier but I can't do that it's not worth the risk to your heart I can't I can't do that you just need to take a long hard look at yourself and what you're doing and if you want help with that we do have pamphlets you know have you thought about and you know doing some exercise that would make you feel more energized
T:	no lack of energy bear on your little day that's not a problem it's just really time to do something else it's just work asleep yeah
C:	so you need to put some thought into if you if that is your lifestyle you're going to have to put some thought into when you can devote some time to looking after yourself so are you putting on weight or have you been loosing the weight
T:	let's think you can be steady
C:	so you've not you've not been losing weight with it
T:	that's been okay
C:	so you can't you know it's it's good that you're standing still but it's not good that you're not losing weight especially if you're on the drugs so clearly the drug wasn't the answer for you and really the only answer for you as is lifestyle changes and you know look at your colleagues and are they what are they eating and adopt some of their policies in was their eating on the hoof they must there must be some of your colleagues that are eating healthy options that you could you could take a flask of soup you know soups salads wraps fruit and veg you know that's that's the only way it's the hard way but it's that's why I think you need to control of it yourself by planning and making sure that you have healthy options available because otherwise you're just going to stay in a vicious cycle and you know drugs we would all like a drug to me things easy for us but I'm afraid it's not the option it's going to be a hard slog but I think I think you'll find that once you start if you get yourself into the right headspace once you start then you will have a sense of achievement and the wheat will start loose you will start losing the weak because if you're that energetic in your job you're obviously doing enough activity so it has to be down to the diet well why don't you make a diary of everything that you eat because you might not realize I had you might be grazing and not realizing it so why don't you keep a food diary and come back and see me and two weeks time can you keep a diet have you got cake keep a diary for two weeks if you if you write down everything that you eat and any extra activity other than running a boat in your jobs that you do and we'll look at that and we're you know before you go and will we when you come back and then we'll see if you can start making a conscious effort and then we'll maybe sit you down with a dietician set you up with an appointment with the dietician to get some nutritional advice but I think you need to start preparing yourself mentally and to be in the right headspace to make this work for you because if you're not in the right frame of mind if you're doing it grudgingly then you're not going to lose weight okay thank you you you
