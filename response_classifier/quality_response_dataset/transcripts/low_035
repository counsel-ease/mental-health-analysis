T:	Hi miss Clark my name is Alan Lyme. Doctor still ask me to talk about your drinking 
C:	okay
T:	he said that you filled out the form and that you came to him for some medication for your stress but they're really concerned about your alcohol consumption. Before I made you any made any prescriptions for you so let me see that form please..okay thanks..yeah well it says here that you drink four more times a week and that you have for one or two drinks and that you go over that limit on a fairly regular basis that's too much that's too much I mean I imagine that he's already told you that he can't prescribe you anything unless you do something about his drinking 
C:	okay I I'm really confused I he did want me to come and talk to you I'm just not real thrilled with the way this is going well 
T:	I'm sure you're not because anybody that the drinks of these levels isn't going to throw talking about her drinking with a professional like myself what we know is that if you if you continue to drink at this rate you're probably going to wind up drinking more and more and imagine as he's concerned as you can order to me now..
C:	I think I was drinking that much I mean a you know one or two glasses of happy 
T:	this is a glass I mean this is a typical glass which is five ounces of wine but but what I know is that most people doing a lot more of that so what I'm pretty sure that your glass is recent bigger than that. What would you say?
C:	you don't... you are not in my household you don't know what idea it is about that size maybe maybe a little more
T:	I don't I've been in the house where they have these stem glasses that's only a restaurant most people have tumblers so imagine that's why I find about good your cupboards and well anyway so what he said was that you came to him for some kind of benzodiazepine something for anxiety and we can't prescribe anything like that much if you're drinking of these levels so we need you to stop or at least cut back to reasonable levels which for you would be number three drinks in one setting which you're drinking over that now or no more than seven drinks among which you are well over right now so if you can agree to that and then perhaps you can make that prescription for I can't promise that either but but that's certainly one thing the other thing you need to do is to read this take this pamphlet and read it and you'll see in there that it tells you about limits of alcohol I think you'll find that if you if you can stick to there you should be okay you may be able to prescribe the medication at that point. I can't promise but if you do have problems and I'm suspect you may have problems coming back to those levels then we can make a referral for you to counselor to come and talk about your increased drinking. So any questions for me? 
C:	and no no questions at all all right
T:	well thanks and I'll talk dr. Zeile you came in and you were reasonably compliant and that you said you'd follow through 
C:	you tell me wherever you want
T:	all right thanks
