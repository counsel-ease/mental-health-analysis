T:	hi you Julie Thompson 
T:	hi I'm horse Berger I work in the clinic I know you're here to pick up a prescription today I noticed that we noticed some your records that you've been coming in and getting Sarah's rescue rescue inhaler for her asthma quite frequently and you haven't got her chronic inhaler for quite some time now I also know she's been in the emergency room several times this year is can you tell me what's going on there 
C:	well I did a research on the chronic inhaler and I saw that there were steroids in it and I do not want my daughter taking steroids I read about all the side effects of steroids and all the potential health problems I don't want her taking them and I just want to tell you right up front I do not want to hear anything about the fact that I do smoke I smoke outside I smoke away from her I do not ever do it around her so I do not want to hear about that
T:	well III need to tell you that the the medicine that she's taking the chronic inhaler which is really essential to controlling her asthma does is not a steroid like you're thinking it's it's much safer it's very safe she and she needs to take it to get her asthma under control and I also want to tell you that your smoking does affect her asthma even if even if it's outside it gets on her clothes and to be honest I'd like to see you quit smoking for you anyway but if you want to keep her out of the emergency room she needs to use that chronic inhaler every day and you need to watch your smoking 
C:	okay I am NOT going to allow her to take any kind of steroid I am NOT going to allow that to happen she's my daughter she's my responsibility and I'm not going to allow that to happen and I absolutely make sure that the smoking does not affect her 
T:	okay I you know I don't want to argue with you about this I I know that if you you died if you want to keep Sarah out of the emergency room I just wish you'd heed what I'm saying she needs to use that chronic inhaler every day to get her to get her asthma under control and the smoke and your clothes and smoking flares her asthma so she really needs to use that chronic inhaler and you really need to think about quitting smoking fine 
C:	I'm in a really big hurry and I need to get those prescriptions filled as soon as possible please 
T:	okay well I hope you really listen to what I'm telling you about it using that chronic hailer and i hope you consider quitting smoking 
C:	fine I just need to get my prescriptions 
T:	good
