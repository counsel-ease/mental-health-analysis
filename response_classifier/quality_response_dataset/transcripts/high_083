T:	able to come in it's just great you know we haven't seen you in like six months how have you been girl
C:	they've been doing a little better yes
T:	we'll talk about that you know it looks like on here that your ac is down a little bit I think it's down to about ten now yeah so you've really been making some progress tell me about how it's been going 
C:	well I do exercise a lot more I exercise a lot more yes I have my little portion controls they don't have too much of a certain food I make sure that you know I have my insulin at the right time the right amount 
T:	so it sounds like you've really been doing a couple different things that have been working for you it's exercising more which I want to hear about and you've been really looking more at your portion sizes yes you know those measuring pieces we had talked to talk some time about yes and then the third one is Oh taking your insulin at the right times okay I'm really the schedule on where it is yes does that seem to be making you feel better as far as the insulin or what do you noticing 
C:	um I'venoticed that well I'm very sure we discussed this before when I used to go out I used to just kind of check my blood sugar and make sure that it was low enough to have whatever I kind of wanted to okay I see right yes well now I mean I still go friends of course but as you should as I said um but one like once I go out now I kind of I tried looking for something like if my friends are gonna have a candy bar or something I try looking for maybe a granola bar or something that's a that's like sort of like a candy bar but it's a little healthier and I know that it won't rise my blood sugar that much 
T:	so you've been looking for other alternatives so you still feel like you're doing one but they're doing I'm looking at the carbs a little or seeing where it would be with your sugars 
C:	yeah like I mean of course I'm teenager I still love candy or whatever but 
T:	nobody can stop you from having candy completely exactly 
C:	but you know I still try go to go out and have fun I mean even though my friends do eat whatever they kind of want I just I take better better care of myself I eat something healthier it's something that'll make me feel more energetic instead of like a little sugar rush and then just crash later on 
T:	so you know how you feel when you get that sugar rush and cry yes that feeling hasn't been something you've enjoyed in the past yeah so you've you've been feeling a little more even keel it sounds like how that's going so talking about the exercise piece you say you've been exercising more what have you been enjoying 
C:	well now that I'm in school I mean I tried out for the basketball team yeah hey yes
T:	oh I know you said you're really looking forward to that
C:	yes and it's a lot of fun I enjoy it the workouts are pretty harsh but I like it I have fun I enjoy it and you haven't been feeling as though your sugar that you want to crash during checkouts
T:	you've been able to manage while you're out with your energy level 
C:	yeah I mean I always keep some fast-acting sugar on me just in case super I'm glad crash 
T:	and that had added something you've had to use or haven't had to use during exercise also know how good deal good so you've been able to kind of go into it with the right sugar level yes so that you haven't bottom doubt 
T:	well with all these things that you've been working on so well what what's your main goal right now what's something that you're you know really trying to be focused on for you 
C:	well my main goal is well I've lowered my ac a little bit but I'm trying to get it to where it's really actually supposed to be so that sure myself healthy you know
T:	so so keep moving in that direction we've got it from a from a  down to a  which is a huge success in the time period that we've been looking at and maybe let's try to move it down even a little further to you know nine to start and move down to an age exactly okay so that's that's that's great so the bigger goal is getting the ac down a little and then these smaller pieces are your what you're doing to make that happen yes so how important is it for you to have an ac let's say eight in the next six months on a scale of one to ten kinda like that pain scale we use where would you put yourself on a scale of one to ten just how important it is 
C:	I would actually have to say about an eighth
T:	it's an eighth Wow so it's not a two or three it's an eighth
C:	my goal I want I really want to reach my goal I want to be able to feel good and you know I want to make sure that I know that I'm healthy and that I know I was the one who did this for myself 
T:	but you said it wasn't about your mom it wasn't about dr. Smith but it was about what Elizabeth wanted yes so what would it take to move you just a little bit higher up to a nine as far as importance what would have to happen 
C:	I'm not really sure actually I mean it's really important to me but I do have you know has to have school and sports exactly you know I have to worry about other things too 
T:	we all have a lot of things we're juggling and to be honest I don't think anyone can ever really be a ten in terms of importance because we have all these things that we have to manage and sometimes they're higher up and sometimes they're lower up depending on the day or even the minute so I'm that same kind of scale of  to  where would you put yourself in terms of how confident you are that you can bring down your ac - what did we say at  within the next six months how confident are you that you can make that happen 
C:	about a  actually 
T:	Wow yeah wow that is awesome so tell me about that 
C:	well I'm really comfident because I mean if I was able to get my blood my ac from  to  and only a couple of months yes I've believed that I can do the same thing again thank you what I'm doing up 
T:	soreally just continuing to do what you're doing you've already shown here in the last few months that you've dropped it substantially and I'm sure you were really excited to get to see that score you know to see what the number was really gonna be 
C:	yeah it made me feel really good I know that I'm doing better and that I'm healthier so 
T:	did you have a sense when you came in did you have an idea of what you thought your number might be 
C:	I did actually because I know that before I wasn't doing as well as I I could and by pushing myself I knew that you know what I know it's lower I know that I did good and I've been taking care of myself I know it's most definitely lower okay
T:	so you could feel confident coming in at hey when I see that number I already know the work I've been doing so it darn well better be lower because yes we're not put into this so that makes sense it sounds like for you just continue to do what you're doing continue on with getting onto the basketball team and you know continuing on with those things you're playing out with your with your insulin you haven't been in the hospital now for over  months so I mean that's you know that's a huge progress in success as far as keeping yourself stable and feeling good and enjoying high school yeah so how bout we check back again you know an hour another  days and just kind of see where that the ac is then yeah and kind of go from there and you know if you have any questions or you're not sure about something by all means you can stop and that's what we're here for okay thanks Liz it's great talking to you today it's great down you too you
