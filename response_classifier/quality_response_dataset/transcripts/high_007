T:	hi Lucy nice to see you today how you been going
C:	yeah well thanks
T:	great I'm just fully get started has anything changed with your medical history since I last saw you like any new medications or serious operations
C:	No
T:	great and is anything maybe worrying you about your teeth or your gums today
C:	I think I might have a hole in my tooth
T:	oh no what makes you say that
C:	I can feel it with my tongue and it's a bit sensitive
T:	mmm well let's lie you back I'll pop some gloves on and we'll have a little look Lucy it definitely looks like you need a filling um I'd love to help you figure out why you've got this new hole in your tooth do you mind if I ask you a few questions so we can try and figure it out
C:	Yeah of course
T:	great well here's a risk assessment form it's just a few questions that might help us figure out what the problem might be
T:	great yeah it says here that you're drinking soft drinks in between meals what do you know about the effect of soft drinks on your teeth
C:	I know it's not good for them
T:	that's right um the bacteria in your mouth can use the soft drink to create acid that eats into the tooth surface and causes the holes the more that your teeth are coated in the sugar the more likely it is that you'll develop a hole did you know the one can of soft drink can have 10 teaspoons of sugar in it
C:	I didn't know that so I shouldn't have soft drinks at all I'm not sure I could do that
T:	yeah I understand it does sound like you're worried about getting holes in your teeth though there are a few options that you can do to help improve how you consume sugar would you like to hear about those
C:	well I don't like getting feelings so that would be great
T:	yeah probably drinking soft drink you could try drinking it all in one go instead of sipping on it or you could try drinking just at mealtimes instead of in between meals so does either of those sound like they might work for you
C:	yeah I mainly sort of drink soft drinks in between meals though maybe I could just have them with lunch and dinner
T:	great I'm in Romania to get a break from the sugar I sort of on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most how motivated do you feel you are to make this change
C:	I don't like getting feelings so an 8 or a 9
T:	great and you maybe have any ideas that you could implement to help you avoid having soft drinks in between meals
C:	I could carry a water bottle around with me
T:	great that's a really good strategy and waters great for you too umm you can also try chewing sugar-free gum I mean is that something you're interested in
C:	I might give the water bottle a try first
T:	okay cool well look I'll put a little note in your file and the next time I see you if it's okay I'll check how you're going with avoiding soft drinks between meals
C:	yeah that'd be fun and hopefully I won't have any holes next time
