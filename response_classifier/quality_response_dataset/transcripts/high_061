T:	good morning Tony
C:	hey
T:	my name is Alex and I'm going to be the nurse taking care of you today so could you please tell me a little bit of about why you're here
C:	I don't even know why I'm here I don't know my mom says I'm obese
T:	so you were your mom suggested to come here because you were obese
C:	yeah I mean I guess so that's why she sent me here yeah honestly she's so mad how they're gonna why everything I don't think I am
T:	okay can I ask you do you see yourself as overweight
C:	No I don't I don't I don't think I'm overweight or obese or whatever she thinks so so that's why I figure
T:	okay well can I tell you a little bit about what being overweight means
C:	yes sure
T:	okay so what it is is basically how we determine that is we're using the BMI so body mass index scale and at the end of it it gives us a number and a number of 25 and higher is associated with being overweight so based on your physical exam results earlier on you're at the 95th percentile
C:	95th
T:	very top of the scale which for lack of a better word but she was overweight
C:	okay well you sure you're right I mean I thought maybe like 27 or something else but
T:	No thats what I have here
C:	95th wow geez I didn't even know what I like okay like what's gonna happen to me now like should I be concern is something gonna happen
T:	there are health risks associated with it but I don't want to scare you I'm going to inform you but before we get there do you mind if I get to know you in your situation a little bit better
C:	yeah sure what do you want to know
T:	so what I like to do is get a little bit of history so throughout this do you mind if I ask you a questions regarding your diet and exercise habits
C:	Yeah sure
T:	okay so so to start us off could you tell me a little bit about what you eat throughout the day so how's your habit like
C:	well I guess like in the morning I'd never eat breakfast it's just like I'm always late you're in a rush and my mom doesn't make breakfast so I don't so when I get to school I tend to be hungry so I go for like the first a large cookie usually and make a large chocolate milk and that usually lasts until lunchtime
T:	okay
C:	and then I have lunch with my buddies we go to the CAF and the regional get french fries and pizza and then after I eat my lunch I usually have like a bag of chips and like two or three pops with my lunch
T:	okay all right so can you tell me a little bit more about what you like about that kind of food
C:	it's comforting okay it's fast it's easy to grab easy to get it tends to be cheap and I get it's like surrounded her it's always it's all around me all the time you know my friends do it like my friends did I eat it with them and I guess it's kind of like a social thing for me my mom isn't cooked so I used to eat it when I get home
T:	oh ok
C:	so it's it's literally everywhere
T:	so let me try to understand so you enjoy it because it's convenient it's on the go and it's always readily available when you need it your friends engage in it and your mom doesn't think it's not exactly of a cookers as much as I understand
C:	yeah
T:	okay so could you tell me a little bit about what are some things that you don't really like about it
C:	well I mean sometimes they make it and there's just so much grease on it that I have the dab it with a napkin to get rid of the greese
T:	yeah
C:	sometimes the line of the calf like it's so long and like my knees were at my back hurts just stand there waiting for it
T:	okay
C:	and to think about it like it's just I guess something to do with my body like that's why I'm yeah right I don't have a I don't have a girlfriend so maybe it's to do something the way I look I'm sure
T:	so let me try to further understand so given the positives you just told me but you also feel like you're in pain for what I'm understanding your back on your knees and it's greasy and maybe you think that it's contributing to your body image and potentially affecting your relationships
C:	that about the summarizes it yeah okay
T:	so given that what you just told me do you think that the food is contributing to your weight gain
C:	yeah like if you put it that way I do think it does contribute when we gain plus like I hate to say it but like mom I think my mom is right like she her nagging is annoying but I think she just means well and once you know for my health it's just for my health
T:	ok so not that I think we covered food and I understand a little bit better can I ask you about your exercise habits some things like any physical activity you engage in or anything like that
C:	I mean exercises mean exercise don't cold water they're like that's just not my thing okay like I don't plan on going to a gym I don't plan on getting into membership like just I mean exercise don't work
T:	okay so if I understand you correctly it is about your priority right now
C:	definitely not my bird oh I think that's like maybe I can focus on something more like eating habits maybe but definitely not exercise
T:	okay so I'm glad to hear that so can I ask you are you considering about making any changes to what you died at this point
C:	yeah like I mean like when I think about it now I don't want to develop some sort of illness in the future and like I definitely don't want to hear from my mom like a colony over way of nagging I mean like so this is definitely something that I'm considered
T:	ok
C:	yeah
T:	so I five believes so if I understand it correctly you're considering to make that change because you don't want to develop a chronic illness later on the life in essentially avoiding conflict with your mother is that correct
C:	yes that's correct
T:	okay so can I ask you on a scale of zero to ten now that you're considering about making a change zero being not important whatsoever and ten being super uber important how important is it for you to make this change
C:	what's it's about like a six well
T:	okay all right and let me ask you another question using a scale again so from scale of zero to ten zero being I'm not confident whatsoever and 10 being I'm super confident how confident are you that you will be able to make this change
C:	let's be honest I would say about like a 4 okay yeah I'm not really that confident
T:	okay so you are on the higher end of the scale in terms of how important it is to you to make that change however you are in the lower end of the scale in terms of your confidence what choose 4
C:	well like I said earlier like fast food is comforting to me and it's all around me and when I like my friends you did
T:	okay
C:	my mom doesn't know the cooks like you don't I get home alright so I just feel that like it's a big part of my life and if I just take it away it's gonna be hard I personally don't feel like I have the will to just like control myself
T:	okay
C:	because like I just feel like I'm just gonna break and like maybe grab a few fries and my friends or something and I'm like I just feel like I mean oh I don't have the will to do thing but at the same time there's you've made me like realize the good of the bad
T:	okay yeah
C:	and I see that like I really do need to be this because it's gonna be the best very
T:	well I'm thank you for telling me that I'm glad to hear that I was able to provide you with some information so that you can take control of your situation so thank you so much but can I ask you something else in order to change or in this case increase that confidence from before to maybe something higher is there anything that can help you with that
C:	well to think about it my my friends were like if they were to eat healthy with me I think that it would help me like increase my confidence and you know accomplish just because like you know they peer pressure and like there would be five days to reach everyday at school right where the see eachother all the time
T:	right okay
C:	another one with us I would say is like maybe my mom like learned to cook something yeah
T:	like cooking class
C:	yeah I'm really good cooking class something cooking book or YouTube or something
T:	okay okay
C:	cook something so I want to take a seconds or a few minutes
T:	I want to say congratulations first of all for coming to see me I know with your mom nagging and that must it must be frustrating for you but it is you took that initiative you no matter through your mom's nagging you still came to see me so congratulations on that
C:	Thank you
T:	and I really want to say also congratulations to taking this first step and seeing that this is something that could benefit you so that you don't want because from what I understand you don't want to develop any chronic illness or any sort of health risk
C:	oh no no
T:	so thank you so thank you for being here and congratulations again for taking that first step so right now would you like to discuss the potential health risks associated with weight gain and overeating junk food
C:	to be honest like I mean we learn about it's in health class and like my mom has to given me these brochures so many times I've read them I kind of get the gist of it
T:	oh I understand
C:	yeah no health teaching today yeah
T:	I'm tired of the nagging I got I know the time to be
C:	got it all right so where would you like to go from here is there any idea that you have that we can start with and you think that you can do during the week
T:	we can do to help you with this change well like was thinking about it maybe like I don't want nothing to do with exercise
C:	got it
T:	but maybe you we can do some sort of like I don't know meal planner I don't know like something to do with like my diet maybe reduce what I'm eating
C:	okay
T:	you know modify some of the things I'm eating I guess like I know pop is bad for me and that those chips so maybe I couldn't like reduce some of that maybe and change it from three to three to one pop a day
C:	got it
T:	there's no more chips okay
C:	so it looks like you have an idea that could potentially do contribute to you to your decreasing what you eat or in this case substituting what you eat in my correct yes make suggestion
T:	yes
C:	may I make a suggestion
T:	yeah sure
C:	sometimes what happens is in order for people to fully realize the behavior that they're engaging in sometimes what ends up in the notices with other clients writing down seems to help so I know what this might sound lame but are you open to the idea of keeping some kind of a log list journal or anything like that that indicates on it somewhere what you're eating and we're and also what you're substituting are you open to that idea
T:	I mean I guess it's like I can see where you're coming like where it could benefit
C:	okay
T:	um so yeah I mean it's worth a shot I mean how how bad can it be right I mean I have nothing to lose so
C:	okay
T:	yeah why not I'll try it so over the next couple of weeks so if we were to set up a follow-up appointment would you be comfortable of keeping that journal and then coming to me after so we can review it together
C:	yeah of course okay you're really good at this thing
T:	thank you so can we let's recap what we talked about today so you came here to see me despite your mom nagging and making you feel like you have to be here because she said so but you were able to see that you were able to identify that this is something this is your decision this is something that would benefit you instead of your mom so you given me the goods and the bads of your junk food and you were able to essentially come up with some kind of an action plan so where its building that awareness of junk food and by being open to the idea of keeping a log is there anything I missed
C:	no I think you got it you got most of it are all of it
T:	yeah so can we make a follow up appointment where we can review that journal after to see what's working for you what's not working for you yeah sure
C:	if something isn't working for you we can always go back to the drawing board
T:	okay
C:	okay
T:	yeah
C:	so shall we set up set up that appointment
T:	yes please Nurse Alice
C:	okay thank you
T:	I'll see you a couple of weeks
C:	all right thanks meeting you Tony thank you
